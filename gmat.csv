What was your (successful) Test day routine?,14,avmpj0,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/avmpj0/what_was_your_successful_test_day_routine/,4,"Interested to hear what habits and routines created a desired outcome for fellow test takers. Maybe even starting with dinner the night before. Things to consider:

* Time you took the test?
* What you ate leading up to the test?
* Any pre-test rituals? (Flashcards, handful of problems, completely staying away from material, reading over notes, exercise, meditating etc)
* Supplements? Any vitamins beforehand?
* During Breaks - did you snack on anything? If so, what exactly?

This was born out of me reading a write up on GMAT Club where a test taker discussed drinking Amino Acids (didn't specify EAA or BCAA for my gym rat friends out there) during his break and I thought to myself, ""that's a really good idea, I wonder if there are any other good test day ideas I'm not considering""

Expectations on re-take?,5,avllf9,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/avllf9/expectations_on_retake/,5,"So I'm writing again on Friday after only scoring a 550 (39q/26v) on the 12th.

My last four practice GMATprep tests have been (from most recent on) 710 (47q/40v), 690 (48q/36v), 610 and 620.

No guide sufficiently teaches you when to drop certain terms in parallelism.,10,av5o5m,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/av5o5m/no_guide_sufficiently_teaches_you_when_to_drop/,2,"I've looked everywhere, and no guide really explains it well.

The only OK one is in MGMAT SC book, which says that you need to repeat the front terms if there is a closed parallel marker.

Example: not in x but also in y. --> IN MUST be repeated.

In open markers, it's not clear.

Consider the following incorrect sentence:

The discovery that Earth’s inner core rotates independently of and more quickly than Earth’s outer layers is responsible for advancing studies of how heat from the inner core flows through the outer planet, and the formation and periodic reversal in direction of Earth’s magnetic field

This is wrong because there is no second OF: studies OF how heat... and OF the formation.. would be correct.

How the heck am I supposed to know what to drop and what to not put? MGMAT SC says to replace an element in front of the start to see if it makes sense. 

The discovery that Earth’s inner core rotates independently of and more quickly than Earth’s outer layers is responsible for advancing studies of the formation and periodic reversal in direction of Earth’s magnetic field. 

This makes sense, so why does OF need to be repeated again? Why can't the OF be distributed to both?

The most frustrating part is that no guide really tells you exactly what should be done. Everybody just says ""needs OF because of parallelism"". But in many cases, the front part can be dropped and still be parallel. 

So when exactly can you drop and when can you not? I thought this one was OK because the sentence completely makes sense if I put the second element in front of the first OF, so OF can be distributed.",1551220989.0

How to maintain a positive attitude while preparing for the GMAT (article),14,atw1z3,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/atw1z3/how_to_maintain_a_positive_attitude_while/,4,"If you’re like many prospective MBA students, you were surprised to hear that most Business Schools require a minimum GMAT score. Once that surprise wore off, you may have adopted one or more of the following attitudes:

**Annoyance:** I have better things to do than take this test!!!

**Indignation:** I had a 4.0 GPA at the Doug Winkleton School of Modern Dance and Appliance Repair, and I still have to prove myself?

**Fear:** Oh no! Now everyone will know that I don’t recall the quadratic formula!

**Depression:** Can I eat ice cream in the testing center?

While these feelings may be completely natural, they certainly won’t help your score. In fact, when your GMAT preparation is clouded in negativity, you end up studying less, and when you do sit down to study, your negative emotions impede learning.

To help improve your study sessions and facilitate learning, it’s important that you adopt a positive attitude.

Am I suggesting that you begin each prep session convincing yourself that today is a SUPER-FANTASTIC day to spend 3 hours studying?

Perhaps.

Am I suggesting that you occasionally pause your study sessions to be thankful that your dream school has set a minimum GMAT score?

Sure.

Am I suggesting that you smile like a deranged lunatic whenever you think of the GMAT, and that you sing the praises of this standardized test to everyone you meet?

Well, that would be wonderful gesture and, if doing so, will improve your score, then by all means, fill your boots!

Sure, all of this may sound silly, but it’s much much MUCH better than swearing through clenched teeth every time you think of the GMAT. Besides, the truth of the matter is that you’re learning a lot of important and useful skills that can be applied to many of your future business activities.

**Reading Comprehension**

Your future business career will undoubtedly involve reading complicated documents and gleaning important information. So, perfecting your reading comprehension skills will not only help you ace the GMAT, but also help benefit your career. Super fantastic!!

**Sentence Correction**

If you’ve spent any time working on Sentence Correction questions, you’ve probably come to the realization that a lot of people around you suffer from bad grammar. As you might imagine, this deficiency can negatively affect others’ perceptions of one’s competence. So, while some Sentence Correction questions may stump you, keep reminding yourself that you’re learning practical communication skills that will inevitably serve you well in the future.

**Critical Reasoning**

Will there come times when you need to present a strong argument or dissect someone else’s argument? Of course!

**Math**

Granted, you probably won’t need to factor many polynomials in your new career, and CEOs are seldom called upon to answer questions about Jeanette’s age (which happens to be twice that of Rita’s age 7 years ago), but you WILL be called upon to apply many of the math skills that the GMAT tests. More importantly, GMAT math questions often require you to think in creative ways. All of this will come in handy in the future.

**Integrated Reasoning**

This section requires you to evaluate information presented in multiple formats, discern patterns, and combine verbal and quantitative reasoning to solve everyday problems. You'll definitely need these skills if you want to succeed in today's data-rich world.

**The Big Takeaway/TLDR**

Of course you’d rather eliminate the GMAT from your to-do list, but the reality is that you must take this test. So, quit complaining, suck it up, and embrace the skills you’re learning, because they’ll inevitably make you a better businessperson.",1550932435.0

I've been out of the game for quite a few years and struggle with basic math (doing from top of my head, after reviewing it, I'm alright with it.)

I just completed my first practice exam (official one) and scored a 430 (Q30 V20 IR7). My target score is around 700. I have taken this one with basically no prep (reviewed a few basic math things over the course of a week with maybe 1h/day). I wasn't expecting a high score (maybe 500) but 430 is significantly lower than I expected. I know exactly my weak points in both, verbal and quant. Quant is mostly data sufficiency where I screw up. Verbal, well, not a native speaker so proper grammar was back in high school which was 10 yrs ago with SC as one of my main problems. I've bought both, OG and Manhattan Prep to prepare for it

When taking the exam I noticed at the end of each section that I rushed through it (15 minutes left on Quant and 18 on Verbal) apart for IR, where I had 2 minutes left. This, to me, is a reason for the low score and why I'm confident I could do a 500+ with a little bit of studying. However, with a target score of around 700, I'm wondering if this is realistic. 

I planned to take the GMAT in the summer, July or August, which leaves me with roughly 5 months prep time. I'm confident I can put in 2-3 hrs on avg per day. I'm not too concerned about the Quant, as I think that with the prep the knowledge comes back. I haven't had to do proper math in the last 6 years, so this is quite rusty, but I'm confident this will be possible with a good amount of studying. 

My concern is more around the Verbal part.

I've been lurking here for a while and love the advice and support in the community! Need some advice and wanted to come here first.

&#x200B;

**Background:**

I'm an analyst in my first year at a mid-tier strat consulting firm (think Accenture, Deloitte, Oliver Wyman). Have a \~3.4 GPA at a top-20 university in social sciences so not super thrilled with my chances especially since I'm an ORM. No good reason, I was immature and didn't take school seriously enough. Lately I've been a little disillusioned with staying in consulting for longer than a few years, so biz school has gotten more and more appealing for a few different reasons. I started reading up on GMAT and MBA boards a few months ago and signed up for the GMAT question of the day which I've done for a couple months. That's been about the extent of my studying, so I wanted to take a diagnostic test at the advice of some posters to assess my strengths and weaknesses.

&#x200B;

**The Test:**

I've been lucky to have parents that pushed me to study for standardized tests from a young age, so I've always been decent at them \~99% on SAT when I took it years ago. I decided to take the official GMAT practice test over the weekend. The verbal portion was pretty straightforward, but the math felt pretty challenging. I was definitely surprised when I saw 750 on the end-screen. Having spoken to a few mentors, they've recommended I just take the test immediately. To be honest, I'm really uncertain about taking it. This feels like it definitely could have been a fluke, and I want to maximize my score in any case to make up for my GPA to be competitive for M7 schools, ideally 770+.

&#x200B;

**Advice Needed:**

I'm pretty set on studying for a month or two before taking the official test. Given my score breakdown and insecurities with being able to be consistent, how should I structure my study plan? I've seen some good daily plans on [GMATclub.com](https://GMATclub.com) as well as an overwhelming amount of paid resources. Some key questions I have are:

How should I divide my studying between quant and verbal?

What are some good resources for each given my diagnostic score? (Ideally free, but willing to pay for solid value)

How much time should I prepare to achieve my goal score?

Any tips, best practices, and advice is definitely needed. Thanks for reading my post guys!!! <3",1550764465.0

It is so frustrating because the more work I put in, the worse I'm getting (or no improvement). I believe it's because I am much more analytical, look for specific rules, and overthink. Just going by what ""sounds right"" would probably net me more correct answers at this point. 

Anybody ever been in this situation? Really don't know what I can do. I honestly just start to lose confidence when I see SC questions now (whereas before I was actually quite chill just looking for big fundamental rules and what sounds right) and end being disheartened thru the whole exam.

The deadline I set for myself was the 4th of March. However, I am currently unsure about when to take the test. I would like to just leave this all behind me and pass the test ASAP. So now I am debating between taking the test on the 22nd of February or the 4th of March.

Any advice would be appreciated.

"GMAT Debrief. 730 (Q49V41) One month of study, missed target of 750+.",13,ar1vcw,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ar1vcw/gmat_debrief_730_q49v41_one_month_of_study_missed/,8,"Took the GMAT today and scored a 730 (Q49/V41) with an IR of 8.

**Prep**

Started studying one month ago, and early on took a diagnostic test and got a score of 700 (Q45/V40) on the official GMAT Prep. I studied probably an average of 4 hours a day. I did frequent CATs to track progress and practice under test-like conditions, in total I did about 15 with my lowest score being 690 and my highest being 760. A typical study day would be performing a full-length CAT (mostly on GmatClub or Veritast) and then reviewing the questions I got wrong thoroughly. I also did practice problems in weak areas, which for me were geometry questions, and sentence correction.

I made a post 3 days ago freaking out about sentence correction as my verbal scores got lower the further I practiced. I watched pretty much every sentence correction video on youtube the next day (seriously, about 8 hours worth), and I think it helped considerably. Yesterday, I did the second official test and managed to score 760 (Q50V44). Although I improved my sentence correction, the only questions I got wrong in verbal were on sentence correction.

My most recent tests prior to the official one were (in order of recency):

760 (Q50V44) - Official GMAT

760 (Q51V41) - Veritas

720 (Q50V37) -GmatClub

720 (Q51V35) - Veritas

720 (Q51V36) - GmatClub

730 (Q47V43) - Veritas

750 (Q50V41) - The Economist

**The Actual Test**

I opted for the order of Quantitative, Verbal, IR, then AWA.

Quantitative started good overall. I caught a few tricky mistakes that I would have likely made on earlier CATs, and was pretty confident on almost every answer I submitted. I did quickly guessed two questions I saw, one around question 9 and one around question 20 that were confusing and seemed difficult. The big problem with Quant was timing for me. I unfortunately only had 4 minutes left with 4 questions to go. I got stressed and ended up having to guess the final 3 questions. It felt even worse because from glancing at the questions, I knew I could solve them, but just didn't have the proper time to. On the vast majority of my previous CATs I didn't have issues with timing, but I think today I was more likely to spend time double and triple checking answers, which was a mistake.

Verbal was interesting. I found the critical reading and reading comprehensions noticeably harder than the ones I encountered on previous CATs, but the sentence correction quite a bit easier. Again, I ran out of time, and had to rush the last five questions and completely guess on the last question. This was never an issue for me during the CATs - I often finished with 5-10 minutes left in Verbal. I think I fixated too much on a few sentence correction problems, too scared to make an error, another mistake.

**Result**

While I recognize my 730 is a good score, I can't help but be a bit disappointed, considering I scored 760 on the two previous CATs I did, including a 760 on the official practice test the day before. Furthermore, I had scored Q50 or Q51 in 8/9 of the previous CATs, so scoring Q49 was surprising. V41 was a welcome score, but also below scores of V44, V42, V43, and V45 I had scored on earlier practice tests.

Thankfully, I got an IR of 8. The IR questions seemed shockingly easy, and I was actually worried that I must have answered a lot of questions wrong if the test was feeding me questions of this difficulty. I finished the IR with 10 minutes left. The essay prompt was more difficult than a lot of the practice tests, but I believe it went well.

The question now becomes whether I retake the test or not. On one hand, I'm at or above the average GMAT score of everywhere I'm applying (LBS, INSEAD, Columbia, Yale, Haas,Rotman), but on the other hand I also know I can improve the score if I tried and with additional sentence correction study and better time management, I do think a score of Q51/V45 could be achievable, which would give me a huge boost. Advice welcome and thanks for reading.",1550268228.0

Guessing on the GMAT (article),8,aq730w,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aq730w/guessing_on_the_gmat_article/,0,"The following is a metaphor for how students often respond to a particularly tough GMAT question:

*It’s a dark, moonless night, and you find yourself alone in a haunted house. Blood drips from the ceiling, and the words “Get out!” echo throughout the cobwebbed halls. You’re terrified so, naturally, you head upstairs to investigate.*

Well, that’s how events seem to play out in most horror movies, but any sane person would get out of the house immediately.

On the GMAT, the same logical instinct should apply to ridiculously scary questions. Once you’ve identified a question as such, DO NOT go upstairs to investigate. Just get out! 

Now, before I go any further, I want to explain what I mean by *ridiculously scary questions.* These are insanely confounding questions where you have no idea where to begin, or you don’t even understand what the question is asking. These types of questions smell hopeless, and nothing in the world is going to change that for you. This is what I mean by *ridiculously scary questions*.

Of course, the BEST strategy is to be so prepared that there’s no such thing as a scary GMAT question. Unfortunately, most test-takers aren’t in this envious position, so the computer-adaptive nature of the GMAT practically ensures that everyone will encounter his or her share of ridiculously scary questions. So, you might as well have a strategy for handling them.

The best tactic is to know when to quit and heed the ominous advice to “Get out.”  More importantly, get out EARLY! 

The biggest obstacle to the get-out-early strategy is the mistaken notion that all questions deserve about 2 minutes of our time. While preparing for the GMAT, most of us learn that, in order to complete each section on time, we have about two minutes to spend on each question. Unfortunately, many interpret this as meaning we should never consider guessing on a tough question BEFORE two minutes have elapsed. This misguided notion can kill your score. The truth is, if you encounter a question that you have zero chance of answering correctly or even eliminating answer choices, why spend two minutes staring at it? Give yourself 30 seconds (at most) and then guess and move on. This way, you’ll have extra time to spend on questions that you actually have a chance of answering.

Remember, you can have incorrect responses on the GMAT and still get a perfect 800 score. If your target score is the 600 range, then you can have many incorrect responses. So, don’t waste time blindly fumbling with questions that you’ve identified as next-to-impossible. Move on from your weaknesses to your strengths.

For the perfectionists out there, this is a tough pill to swallow (*Me, guess? I don’t think so!!*). If this is you, then I offer the following advice: Get over yourself, and look at the big picture. Remember, the goal is not to obsess over every single question; **the goal is to** **maximize your score**, and guessing is an integral part of that. ",1550067851.0

How to learn Sentence Correction? Cannot improve above 50%. GMAT Scheduled in 3 days.,6,apvx12,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/apvx12/how_to_learn_sentence_correction_cannot_improve/,4,"Tl;dr at bottom. Hi all, I have my GMAT scheduled in 3 days and am aiming for a 750+.

My studying has went mostly well, my most recent quant scores on my last four practice tests have been Q51,Q50,Q51,Q51 which is a huge improvement over the Q45, Q46 I got on my first two diagnostic tests (one month ago).

My verbal on the other hand has not improved despite significant practice (over 10 CATS, all reviewed after, and another 100+ practice problems). Even more disheartening, I seem to be scoring worse the more I practice, specifically at sentence correciton. I started with a good verbal score of V40, V42 on my first two diagnostic tests. My last 4 verbal scores however have been all over the place: V41, V37, V35, V36. I also managed to get V45 about 8 tests back, although now that's feeling like a complete fluke.

My mistakes are almost exclusively in sentence correction. On my most recent V41 test I got 11/11 CR correct,  10/12 RC correct, and... 6/13 sentence correction correct. The test before (V37) I got 9/10 CR correct, 12/12 RC correct, and... 7/14 sentence correction correct.

It's frustrating because it seems like if I were able to figure out sentence correction, I could be aiming for 770+ scores. The more I study sentence correction the more I seem to overthink it and mess rules up, I seem to have more trouble with it now (after doing 100+ questions of it) than prior to any study.

At this point I almost feel like I am better off just reading the questions and choosing what sounds ""right"", rather than overthinking all the various rules, but if I do this I know I will also inevitably make mistakes. Has anyone been in this situation and if so, were there any tools that helped? Are there any good online resources that can teach me sentence correction? Is there a better way to approach sentence correction? Currently I read through all 5 answers, eliminating ones that are clearly wrong. I then compare answers that seem like they could be correct, establish the differences between them, and try to determine which version of the difference is the correct idiom/tense/form etc. Is there a better way?

Tl;dr: How can I improve at sentence correction, other than doing practice problems? Are there any resources that can help me improve a score in 3 days?",1549993207.0

Hi all, so I've been studying since October and I'm definitely noticing significant improvement in my math. I haven't done a full fledged practice test yet (mostly because I'm anxious af) but I've done a TON of custom tests. 

On easy and medium difficulty type questions, I can easily average 100%. On hard, I can average about 70%. Very hard isn't great, with an average of probably 30%. Often, I will put the custom test on ""Adaptive"" mode, but the questions are almost always very hard, so naturally I don't end up doing that well. I'm not aiming for a very high score on the GMAT. I would be happy if I pulled off a 650. 

My question is, by being able to answer most easy, medium and hard questions, is this enough to pull off a 650 (assuming my Verbal is above par?), or is it necessary to really understand the very hard questions? 

Appreciate any advice anyone can give me!

Would really appreciate some perspective on choosing when to take GMAT based on two deadlines. What would you do?,2,aphsi2,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aphsi2/would_really_appreciate_some_perspective_on/,7,"Hi all, 

Throwaway account. I attended an open house recently for a program that’s perfect for many reasons, and decided to go for it. I live in Europe. My parents are English speakers so I’m native, and as the program of my choice (finance) is in English, I have decided to take the GMAT. 

The early admission deadline is mid-March, and the normal is early May. 

My understanding is that GMAT scores are sent within 20 days, and as I would prefer not to cut it close with the application deadline, I’d ideally take the GMAT within the next two weeks. If I’d opt for the early May application deadline, I’d have until early April to study.

Normally I would opt for the later deadline and take my time to study, but during the open house I received such conflicting messaging about the importance of the score. The director of admissions suggested that I shoot for a 650, but also said that they’re flexible on scores especially as I finished undergrad a few years ago. A student in the exact program I want to do reassured me her GMAT score was “terrible” (but didn’t specify what). 

If I apply early, I have a better chance of getting in, more time to find an apprenticeship (which could help me pay for the program), and I’ll have my year sorted sooner (have been unemployed for 6 months).

If I apply later, I’ll have more time to practice, hopefully a better chance at a good score, and will feel better about spending the money to fly to the capital to take a $250 test. 

TL;DR for a program that doesn’t seem to put too much emphasis on GMAT, should I just say “screw it” and take the GMAT in less than two weeks from now, or take my time and study? I’m asking here because I tend to overthink things.

"Verbal is declining, Quant is improving: Getting from 600 to 700 possible?",5,ap6vva,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ap6vva/verbal_is_declining_quant_is_improving_getting/,1,"Update Edit: So to follow up, I took the real exam again, and got a 600 just as predicted, improving from Q31/V34 on real exam #1 to Q38/V35 on real exam #2.

My Critical Reasoning jumped from the 53rd to 74th percentile, and my Sentence Correction improved from 73rd to 87th. Meanwhile, Reading Comprehension (the thing I'm supposed to be good at) nose dived from 85th to 47th. My timing looks good, with an average of 2:12 per CR, 1:59 per RC, and 1:23 per SC.

My new study plan is to go through all of Target Test Prep to continue pushing my Quant higher, crank out LSAT questions to work on the CR and RC portions of the verbal (switching back to official GMAT questions after a few weeks), and crank out official GMAT SC questions along the way. I plan to be done with TTP by mid-April, and then will crank out all official GMAT Quant and Verbal problem sets for a few weeks, and then take exam #3 sometime in May.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the title says, I am seeing a decline in my verbal performance, while quant is improving. What is the best resource to improve my verbal? And how can I best attack this while continuing to maintain and improve quant? I am attempting the GMAT for the second time next week, and sadly it looks like there will be at least a third attempt. My best practice score is a 600 and I want to hit 700.

For some background:

1. I am a native English speaker and graduated college last year with a social sciences degree... so I figured I would be pretty good at reading and comprehending complex arguments.
2. I took the real GMAT over a year ago cold (less than 5 hours of prep to understand the format and basic question types) and got a 550 (Q31 V34). Took a break and didn't do anything GMAT related until after college.
3. Took a Manhattan Prep class in-person, and have taken 5 Manhattan CATs over the past 6 months, scoring a 490 (Q22 V35), 520 (Q26 V36), 590 (Q39 V33), 600 (Q39 V34), and 580 (Q37 V33).
4. Since the third Manhattan CAT (590), I have also taken two Official CATs, first scoring a 600 (Q39 V33) and just today a 600 again (Q41 V32).
5. As far as studying goes, I focused more on quant during my Manhattan class, and tried to complete all of their weekly assignments both during and after the class. The Manhattan CAT 590 and first Official CAT 600 came right before Thanksgiving... then the holidays put a hiatus in my studying...
6. Since the new year, I have been putting in around 20-25 hours a week (about a 60/40 quant/verbal split) going through the Manhattan books and online interact videos, and doing some official practice problems. I also used some LSAT material to practice CR and RC equivalents. The 600 Manhattan CAT was 3 weeks ago, 580 Manhattan CAT last week, and Official 600 CAT today.
7. CR is my weakest verbal area, and I seem to be running into timing issues on all categories of verbal... had less than 2 minutes remaining by question 30 on this most recent practice CAT.

Basically, I need a study program that can improve my CR, and help me get faster at all verbal while still maintaining comprehension and accuracy of SC and RC problems. My target verbal score is a 40+. I also need to maintain all of my quant gains, and ideally would like to improve quant to a 45+.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Real GMAT baseline 550 (Q31 V34)... lots of studying and many practice CATs later, Official CAT 600 (Q41 V32)... how to get a 700 (Q45+ V40+)?

Came to the realization that if I want my small business to be a bigger business, I'm going to need to get an MBA (or hire someone who does).  Already have a B.S. and M.S in my field, but those don't count for much on the business end. I'm pursuing an MBA purely for the soul sucking reason that without one, anything related to banks, money, lawyers, local government, etc is \*that\* much harder of an already uphill fight.  If you don't have those three letters after your name, you're dead to everyone who can potentially help you.  Faulty premise from the get-go; doing business school for real world practical application!

&#x200B;

I signed up for a GMAT prep class from Local Directional University™ and have been doing workbooks, quizzes and online stuff to get prepped for the prep class.  Most of those were coming up with a 450-550 which is OK considering I've been out of school for a while and am unfamiliar with the test. That's why I signed up for the prep course, right?!?

&#x200B;

Today was our first session and it was the first free practice test on [MBA.com](https://MBA.com) (which I knew and expected). Used most of my time and made an honest effort, full well knowing that this is the first step. No pressure, just need to get a temperature reading and go from there.

&#x200B;

I scored a 370.

Integrated Reasoning: 3

Quantitative: 12

Verbal: 27

&#x200B;

Shit.

&#x200B;

Knowing that:

1. A score below 700 is not worth submitting
2. Gains of 200 points, even after months of intense study, are a rarity
3. A score of 370 indicates I shouldn't use a fork without supervision levels of stupidity

&#x200B;

Am I about to waste a couple months of time and effort for the privilege of clicking ""do not submit""? Prep class is already paid up, so I'll suffer through it like a good Catholic.

&#x200B;

To be clear, I'm not looking for a pep talk. I know that as the prep course goes on, and I'm more familiar with the test, the score will go up.  Also realize I'm not an idiot, but I've gotta dig in my heels if I want to make a go of it.

&#x200B;

The idea that in the end I'd still only hit <600 is really frustrating and maybe not worth my time. Thoughts?",1549748704.0

\- have very limited time till taking the exam (1 month in my case)

\- would like to improve in the quantitative section mainly

&#x200B;

Background

I just finished my undergrad degree in business and I'm not a native speaker of English. My quant skills are considered to be slightly above average among business undergrads, while my verbal is significantly above average in the same pool. I was required to the GMAT for a Master in Management program in Europe and decided to apply close to the deadline - leaving a quite short window to take the GMAT. Target score was 700+.

&#x200B;

Overview

My base score was 640 (39Q, 40V) and I realized that there is more room for improvement in the quant section, so I spent 80% of my prep time on that. I clocked in around 160 hours of prep altogether in one month - basically a full-time job... I quit my internship so that I could focus solely on the GMAT. I practiced Quant by topics and did a hell lot of reinforcement activities.

&#x200B;

Study Plan

After realizing the lack of content knowledge in the Quant section, I decided to purchase gmatprepnow's subscription which I highly recommend. I watched all the videos in order and did all the questions section-by-section from gmatclub. The reinforcing activities are very important and contribute more to your improvement than just the understanding of the concepts after reading an article/watching a video. I finished the Quant section content-wise after around 3 weeks and had 1 week left to practice CATs, weak points in Quant, and the whole Verbal section. I took the second Official Prep Test and scored 710 (Q47, V40), with a nice 8 point improvement in Quant. I still had some topics where I couldn't answer all the questions and also ran out of time while taking the test, so decided to rehearse some of the weak Quant topics and take 4 more CATs (1 each day) to practice pacing. I also spent around 30 hours with Verbal by watching GMAT Ninja videos on Sentence Correction and Critical Reasoning on Youtube. Even though I found them super helpful, watching them didn't seem to contribute to my Verbal score in the end. 

&#x200B;

Test Day and the night before

I had my worst night in years the night before the exam, couldn't fall asleep for hours and woke up frequently even after. In total, I think I slept no more than 3 hours.  I'm a pretty nervous type, so my best advice if you are like me is to do some jogging/exercising the day before the test to make sure your body will definitely want to rest during the night!

I woke up pretty sleep-deprived but the adrenalin helped me a bit during the test I think. Due to the lack of sleep, it is quite likely that I made 1 or 2 more careless errors than I did in the practice tests, but even with those I still scored 710 (48Q, 39V), which was my average for the last practice test leading up to the actual GMAT, giving a quite realistic score.

I guess I’ve used so little math in the past 7 years that I find myself struggling with even the most basic concepts.

I have been doing some research but a lot of the posts and videos I find are from highly academic students or from people planning to attend highly ranked institutions. I got good grades in University but I'm definitely not a straight A student. I did really well in high school too but I have forgotten most of what I learned tbh (specially math). I also work full time so I can only study during evenings and weekends. The Universities that I am looking at require a score of 600. Of course, I am aiming a lot higher than that. I'm hoping to get at least 650, but I am aiming for a 700. I'm also hoping that I will only have to write it once, but of course I will write the exam as many times as needed until I get a good score!

Since a research career was not for me, I pivoted to manufacturing in F500. I've had immense success because my strengths in communication and organization, as well as my intuition for innovation, have led to patents, travel opportunities, and great outcomes for our design teams. Getting a LSS Black Belt opened me up to operations management, and that became my intended focus for business school.

Parts of this process made me feel as though I was revisiting high school. The amount of insecurity I've witnessed in forums regarding GMAT and MBA is staggering. If you're the type of person who puts others down, etc., in business, this attitude will cause your relationships to fall apart, and you'll wonder why your model of the world isn't working. Don't ever look down on someone because of a score, and don't ever look down on yourself because of your score either. Work hard and commit to your values and things will work out.

**Preparation**

I started off by purchasing the GMAT Official Guide 2018 (OG 2018). I also purchased the Complete GMAT Strategy Guide Set (Manhattan Prep GMAT Strategy Guide). I would argue that these purchases are mandatory. The Manhattan GMAT (MGMAT) set is a very good overview of the material that I'd long forgotten in a wide range of math topics.

One of the first pieces of advice I read about on gmatclub and reddit was to take an initial practice test through mba.com and benchmark my capability. I also scheduled an exam for the near future (about 2 weeks out) to get an official benchmark of my performance.

Getting this score was good information but I would recommend studying intensely for at least a month or two before taking your first official exam. The real takeaway was that I was dramatically underperforming in math, which came as a surprise. I wasn't used to Data Sufficiency and sped through the problems (a.k.a. being lazy).

**Test Day 01**

Breakdown Q38 (33%) V34 (71%) IR6 (70%) AWA 6 (88%)

No surprises here. I was a little nervous, but honestly, I had no idea what I was doing. I don't recommend sitting for an official exam if you don't feel prepared. If there's one exam where luck is removed, it's the GMAT.

The month of August was a 1 to 2 hours a day of MGMAT workbook review during the week, and 3 hours a day during the weekend. The issue with MGMAT materials is that it's not preparing you to take the exam, it's just helping you learn and re-learn old concepts. That's useful, but don't confuse your subject knowledge with your knowledge of how to take the GMAT. MGMAT materials may be necessary but not sufficient. There are sections in the MGMAT books that are designed to help you prepare for the GMAT, but they were not effective for me. I do not recommend MGMAT practice tests. To me, they're not representative of the real thing.

It was around this time that I discovered EMPOWERgmat through several recommendations on reddit. I wanted a way to turbocharge my preparation and add structure to the studying process. EMPOWERgmat not only did that for me (error logs, an online interface, flexible modules based on needs), but gave me significant insights into the test (frequency of questions appearing, tactics by test-writers, etc), as well as encouragement to succeed (hence, EMPOWER). I purchased the online version of the 2018 GMAT Official Guide and put it on my kindle so that I wouldn't have to travel with the large textbook. My focus was primarily on math since I targeted >50% in math and had a ways to go.

**Abyss**

Disaster struck. I was on a business trip when I became very ill from a bacterial infection. This eventually led to me fainting and receiving a concussion. It's been a month since I took the GMAT for the last time, and I am still recovering from symptoms of post-concussion syndrome. It might take me 6+ months from today to fully heal.

I put my GMAT preparation completely on hold during the month of September because my post-concussion symptoms were severe (confusion, light and noise sensitivity, dizziness, head pressure, etc.). In October, I completed several open interviews and campus visits because I knew that they would provide me the best chance to introduce myself to faculty, students, and staff. I was not alright and I could not focus on study materials, let alone look at a computer screen.

**Slowly healing**

I didn't study at all between my accident and my next practice test. But I used every bit of my EMPOWERgmat knowledge on the practice exam.

Q45 (57%) V39 (89%) IR4 (40%) AWA Written

I was relieved by this result. Even though I still had facial tingling, numbness, and a fever, I obtained the highest practice test score to date. Ostensibly, I didn't have permanent brain damage. At this point I'd probably studied about 60-80 hours total. I wasn't logging my hours because I didn't think it was important and I didn't believe that I should have an ""hours"" target, but rather a feeling of how prepared I was (based on testing), which I still think is healthy. However, I believe that one should be able to reasonably expect to spend 100+ hours to perform well on this exam.

I studied using EMPOWERgmat math modules for another week and performed another practice exam.

**I didn't know the Abyss had a basement**

A rare snow storm came in mid-November and I was involved in a nasty car accident. I was so fortunate that I didn't strike my head, but my car was totalled. EMS took me to the hospital, and assured me that I didn't sustain a second concussion while I was healing. Because concussion symptoms can take days to arise, I waited for them with worry.

Q44 (52%) V42 (96%) IR1 (0%) AWA skipped

I skipped the IR section since I found it to be straightforward and I read that it was not as critical for b-schools to evaluate. I skipped the AWA because the structure is predictable, b-schools do not value it as heavily, and I'm naturally good at writing essays in a short period of time. A few criticisms of the argument, sprinkle in some counterpoints, organize your essay structure and you're golden. Everything was going in the right direction, even though I was in a car accident only days ago. I still wasn't studying at all for verbal but my work on math was holding steady. I do recommend that people study verbal strategies offered by EMPOWERgmat even if they are native English speakers with an advanced understanding of the language. I found them to be helpful, even after scoring V42 (which may be a little luck attributed to superior knowledge for certain topics).

Prior to test day I wanted to obtain a little more confidence about how to pace myself through the math section. I distinctly remember that Thanksgiving was a particular horrible time for my symptoms. I had awful headaches about 3 weeks after my car accident. I was feeling good after a practice pattern of 690, 710, and 690.

Q 47 (61%) V 32 (66%) IR 7 (82%) AWA 6.0 (88%)

I got a decimal question on the last problem in the quant section (I always did quant then verbal then the rest) and I couldn't get it out of my head after the break. Little did I know that I had just achieved my best ever math score. I carried this anxiety into the verbal section, and I got destroyed. I decided to regroup and focus on my test anxiety. My anxiety stems from feeling like I'm not in control. So I decided to focus on my Verbal so that I could improve my confidence in the section and not succumb to anxiety. I also spent some time focusing on basic concepts in exponents and inequalities, which were weak areas for me, by using the Khan Academy modules that were linked by EMPOWERgmat. These were pretty helpful.

Unfortunately, I had another setback with my post-concussion symptoms. I tried to go back to work for two weeks (I had been working the entire time but mostly from home because the vertical vibrations from driving created bad symptoms for me) and during these two weeks I did about 2 months of damage to my brain (that would require me to avoid driving for this length of time to recover back to where I was). Over my holiday break I was experiencing tension on the sides of my head and an inability to focus. I tried to study as much as possible but had to lay down for 2 hours for every 30 minutes of effort. It was brutal. During this time, I finished the EMPOWERgmat verbal modules on Sentence Correction and Critical Reasoning (I had done the RC modules in the past). I needed to know where I was at prior to test day, so I took a practice exam while skipping the IR and AWA sections.

To hell with it, I thought. I spent the rest of the day in bed and just rested until it was time for the exam the next day.

I wasn't anxious when I arrived to the test center. I was just telling the proctors, who I'd met for the third time now, ""let's just get this over with."" I wasn't overly confident or sad. I was focused, I knew what I needed to do, and I stuck to my plan. My favorite analogy is ice hockey, where players have a few key ideas in their head that they need to repeat to themselves to ensure they minimize mistakes. ""Go to the net. Be hard on the puck. Shoot first. Skate hard. Keep your feet moving."" Except with the GMAT it was ""Don't spend too much time on one question unless you have a plan. Triage according to EMPOWERgmat tactics. Inconsistent means insufficient."" And other EMPOWERgmat nuggets that were drilled into me.

As many others have said, I stared at the screen with my mouth agape and accepted my score. I was thrilled. I could have done a lot better under normal conditions, but I just signed my ticket for at least one b-school program that I'd targeted. It was a hell of a journey but I owe the majority of my success to EMPOWERgmat. There were a lot more EMPOWER modules i could have finished, but I only completed the course to about 70% of the overall offerings.

I do recommend gmatclub for studying as well. There are amazing resources on this website. If I could spare another 50-60 hours I think I could easily hit 720 or above, but the clock ran out for me. I would have focused on my weak areas (probabilities, geometry) and that would have cleaned up my low-hanging fruit. You do get out what you put in. Some people start with a better memory of this material than others. But the GMAT is not an intelligence test by any means. Start early and get the score you want.

* I've been studying the past 3 months (probably only around 100 hours total, I moved apartments in December so that threw me off track). 
* I read through the MGMAT books in the first two months and the past month I've just been doing question sets from OG, but I feel like I never improve (only getting 50-60% questions correct).
* I haven't been keeping an error log - going forward how do I create one and use it properly to actually improve? I feel like whenever I review question solutions I say ""wow I'm dumb how did I not realize to do that"" especially for quant
* For verbal (RC and CR), I just feel like I can't comprehend well - I make a passage map which I feel like takes forever, but then when I read the question, I feel like I didn't understand the passage properly. I also take way too long answering verbal questions

Also, there's another weekend exam offering in either early April or end of May - do you think it's better to retake it earlier so I won't forget everything or take it in May so I have more time to study?

I've been reading stories and advice on this sub for months and recently decided to take the GMAT plunge as a new years resolution. I started with a diagnostic from Orion, which put me at a score of 560. I found this to be a bit disheartening since my target score (looking to go to a T15) is 720. Regardless, I dismissed this result as an adequate ""cold"" starting point and pressed on.

After my trial on Orion was up, I did some research and settled on Magoosh as my training course of choice. I've been putting in about 5 hours a week, focusing on my trouble areas in Quant. I'd say my biggest problems mostly centered on geometry, given that I haven't touched any area/volume equations since middle school. After a deep dive on that and about 140 other quant problems (with a sprinkling of verbal as well), I went ahead and took my first full practice exam and got a LOUSY 560 (31Q, 35V, 8IR) yet again.

My target test date isn't until late June, so I realize I have plenty of time, but I certainly am a bit down given the amount of time I've already put into this test. Has anyone else had similar initial issues who were able to turn things around? What strategies did you utilize to get a good score? I appreciate any advice and thank you so much!

EDIT: I just remembered something that is likely important - for both the Quant and Verbal sections during the OG practice test, I finished with over 25 (!) minutes left. Clearly I have serious rushing/test anxiety issues. Any advice on how to better time myself? Thanks again!",1548890000.0

Want to Take A GMAT Class This Summer - Manhattan or Veritas?,2,akuab4,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/akuab4/want_to_take_a_gmat_class_this_summer_manhattan/,3,"I know this question has been asked a billion times; however, the majority of the Manhattan / Veritas comparison posts aren't all that recent, the ratings are around the same, and the threads are full of reps from both companies. I would like to hear unbiased opinions from people that have taken the class and/or taken the test within the past 2 years.    


For background, my plan is to start self-studying with the Princeton Review prep books (I'll probably get Kaplan or the official GMAC book after I'm done) and other free means before taking an official practice test. I'd like to start class soon after taking the mock practice test, continuing with self-study with a focus on my weaker areas in between taking the mock test and starting the class. My goal is to get as close to a perfect score as possible.   


Off the bat, I know I'll have to work more on the math-heavy topics, since it doesn't come as easy to me as Writing or Verbal. I learn best through a mix of instruction and doing - with space to ask clarifying questions. Manhattan appeals to me because it seems like the questions they use are harder than the test;  I like the idea of practicing at a higher standard, so the questions on the actual test feel less daunting. Veritas appeals to me because the price is cheaper and I like the fact that students can re-take the course for free if they want to take the test again.   


Any thoughts from would be appreciated. If you are comfortable doing so, I appreciate if you'd include your learning style in your post, as it would help me get a better idea of which would be the best fit for my learning style. Thank you so much.

GMAT Write (online AWA practice)

When I first started, I did about 4 hours a week until the month before test day, then kicked it up to 8-10 hours a week. I have a very demanding job, so that was all I could give while still maintaining my mental & physical health. I completed the Kaplan book cover to cover and did some extra OG quant practice. I hardly studied any verbal and did not do any AWA practice outside of practice tests. 

After five months, 100+ hours of studying, and the 710 & 730 practice test scores, my first official GMAT was heartbreaking. I was overwhelmed with doubt that I could do any better. Cue imposter syndrome. 

I took a few weeks off, then I got the Manhattan books from a friend and completely changed my study routine. I booked a test day 2 months out and set my calendar for 8-10 hours a week. I evenly split my studying between quant and verbal. I’d go through a chapter of a Manhattan book, then complete a handful of corresponding questions in the OG. Once I finished that book, I would keep doing practice problems of that type. So by the end, I would be practicing SC, CR and RC after each verbal Manhattan chapter. I kept a detailed error log and timed every single practice problem. I made flashcards and uploaded them to my phone so I could practice on the go. I bought the GMAT Write program to get extra AWA practice and an actual score. I clocked an additional 80 hours of studying. Even though my practice tests were 750-760, I still doubted myself. Cue imposter syndrome again. 

Walking away with a 750 yesterday... It was all worth it. The amount of time, money and energy I spent. So worth it. Keep your head up, folks. Here’s what I learned along the way:

1. If you have a high goal, take it seriously. You’ll have to cut into your personal and social life to make time for this. Don’t study with a beer while your SO watches TV. 

2. Take care of yourself. I maintained a lifestyle with 7+ hours of sleep per night and going for runs 3-4 times a week. I did not sacrifice my health and well-being for this test. 

3. Keep track of time and errors. For me, this was the only way I truly understood what I was doing wrong and where I needed improvements. 

4. Don’t just work on your weakness, but strengthen your strengths. Not studying for verbal at first was such a huge mistake for me. 

5. YOU CAN DO IT! Don’t doubt yourself. It’s just a test, and only a single component of the B school application. Try not to let it consume you.  (Despite #2 above, I struggled with a ton with anxiety during this journey)

Please don’t hesitate to ask questions or PM me — I’d love to help anyone that I can! GOOD LUCK Y’ALL!!

Take a Practice Test Already! (article),8,ahztye,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ahztye/take_a_practice_test_already_article/,0," 

To set up this article, please consider a forum post from some fictitious wrestling forum:

***The state wrestling tournament is 1 month away, and I want to win the 184-pound weight class. To lose enough weight to qualify for that weight class, I plan to limit my food intake to 2000 calories per day. In addition, I will attend wrestling practice every day. Will this be enough to win? Thanks, John.***  

The answer to John’s question depends largely on his current conditions. For example, does John weigh 250 pounds or 190 pounds? Did he start wrestling last week, or has he been wrestling for years? And so on.

Now consider a type of post commonly found in various GMAT discussion forums.

***I’m taking the GMAT in 1 month, and I need a score of 650 to gain admission to my dream school. I’m planning to purchase the following books/videos/course, and I intend to study 2-4 hours each day. Is this enough? Thanks, Jan.***

This post is analogous to John’s post because the answer here depends on Jan’s current conditions with regard to the GMAT. For example, is she a native English speaker with proficient reading skills, or is English her second language? Likewise, does Jan have a PhD in Mathematics, or has she forgotten everything she learned in high school? And so on.  

As the title of this article suggests, the first step in developing a study plan is to take an inventory of your current GMAT skills, and the best way to do this is to take an [official practice test](http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/download-free-test-preparation-software.aspx).

I advise all of my students to take a practice test within days of beginning their preparation, yet many are reluctant to take *any kind of test* so early on. These students typically voice their resistant in one (or both) of the following ways:

**“I haven’t learned all of the material yet”**

My response: Yeah, that’s how baseline tests work. 

**“A low practice test score will undermine my confidence”**

My response: Unless you have a remarkable history of mastering every activity (skiing, tennis, golf, guitar, piano, etc.) on your first attempt, you’re probably familiar with the less-than-perfect outcomes that most mortals experience at the beginning of *ANY* new endeavor. The GMAT is no different, so get over yourself.  

There are 3 good reasons to take a practice test early in your studies:

1. The test will give you a good taste of what you’ll be preparing for over the coming weeks/months.
2. This will likely be your worst test score, and as your subsequent practice test scores improve, your confidence will undoubtedly increase correspondingly.
3. The results of this test will help you gauge the amount of work required to reach your target score.

Let’s talk more about reason #3.

Upon taking a practice test early in their studies, some students will be pleasantly surprised to learn that they’re already scoring close to (or even above) their target score, in which case they can modify their study plan accordingly. Great!

Other practice-test-takers will realize that reaching their target score will require a LOT of work, and that’s also good. This kind of “wake-up call” early in your studies is much better than the alternative, which is taking a practice test at the end of your prep only to discover that much more work is needed.

So, if you’ve just begun your GMAT journey, take a practice test today. You have much to gain and nothing to lose.    ",1548004209.0

For Veritas, however, I felt pretty confident for most of the test but turns out I was over confident? I don't know...

How could my verbal score see such a huge dip? What confuses me even more is that I have a 72% accuracy on verbal while having a 52% accuracy on quant, and yet, my scores are vastly different.

"740 (Q51, V39, IR8) Score Debrief - Never Give Up!",31,ah2bz0,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ah2bz0/740_q51_v39_ir8_score_debrief_never_give_up/,10,"Hello, Reddit! Or GmatClub! I will be posting this debrief on these two platforms, so if somewhere in the middle of reading this debrief you come to realize that you have already read it once elsewhere, you can close it and do something else with your saved time! :)

I will try to make this debrief as concise as possible, but I have to admit that I am still overwhelmed by the result and, thus, there is a possibility that this text goes much longer than originally intended (spoiler alert, it does). Anyhow, I will do my best to keep this whole thing short, yet thoroughly and very precisely share my GMAT experience with fellow readers :) 

First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am a Canadian citizen, who has lived the majority of his life in Armenia (and some years in Russia, too). For the recent couple years, I have never encountered many issues with speaking English language, as well as with reading or contemplating it in speech. In fact, all of the courses in the scope of my local bachelor's degree program were taught in English, so, essentially, I have had a full English undergraduate education and, to be perfectly honest, I considered (and still consider) myself quite fluent in the language. Naturally, I have always loved and have always been very good at maths, be it high-school algebra/geometry or undergraduate calculus and even statistics. As of now, you probably think of me as some geek who shouldn't have ever encountered any major obstacles with getting a good score on GMAT. The truth, however, is: that wasn't the case at all.

I first got introduced to this test about two years ago, when one of my best university buddies (back then, we were in our junior year of studies) was considering to apply to several prestigious U.S. schools for masters in data science/business analytics. His GPA and overall applicant profile weren't very strong at the moment, so he had to really ace the GMAT to contest his spot under the sunshine. Back then, we spent hours of solving tricky DS questions on GmatClub; I was doing them just because it was fun and some 700 level questions were really challenging for me, hence giving me no other chance but to engage in solving them. 

As the time went on, I started questioning myself whether I should be concerned with my subsequent studies once I am done with bachelor. Gradually, I came to acknowledge that I will need to take the GMAT sooner or later if I ever want to get a chance of studying abroad, and, thus, no longer did I see it as a source of my mental exercise in some of my ample time. 

My friend has taken his GMAT about year and a half ago, and scored 720; to end his story altogether in the context of this debrief and concentrate more on mine, I will just mention that he got admitted to MQM of Duke, Fuqua, and is doing just fine there for already more than a half of a year. I was very happy to know that he succeeded in his initial ambition, and slowly I started convincing myself: now is my time to tackle GMAT and get it done once and for all. 

Just about since September/October of 2017, I started doing Sentence Correction, my second ever encountered section at the time after DS. Things were going fairly smoothly there from the very beginning, and, actually, even to this day I prefer SC to probably any other section of Quant and Verbal in GMAT. Just as I did in case of DS, I grew that little habit of doing Sentence Correction in my free time and trying to learn about certain caveats in 700 level SC questions, which I have been never aware of back then. Note that at that stage of my progress I haven't yet done any preparatory books or other GMAT-associated materials to significantly enhance my performance. 

Anyway, the time went on and I was in the middle of my senior year already, nowhere near to applying to top U.S. schools within appropriate deadlines. Till the very end of my undergraduate studies, I could not motivate myself enough to continue prepping for GMAT and exploring other sections, such as CR and RC (Problem Solving was nothing very unusual from the very beginning of my GMAT journey, for it was of a super traditional, commonly observed format for me). At some point, I can clearly tell that I was feeling very burned out by the preparation, and eventually I thought there is no way that I will ever see a 700/710+ score, even during the practice test.

Things started turning around slowly, but surely somewhere from June-July of the preceding year: it was then that I found myself in possession of all MGMAT guides (who would have thought that if I asked my friend to share his study resources, he would delightfully provide me them?). While I would not assert that these books constituted a completely groundbreaking GMAT strategy (at least for me), all of them but the one on Sentence Correction (which is just honestly a must-have even if you consider yourself a SC expert) were, nonetheless, of a great assistance for some quick revision of certain Quantitative and Verbal concepts. By the end of the summer, I have done all MGMAT books but the ones on Reading Comprehension and IR/AWA and have begun to delve deeper in the realm of Critical Reasoning. 

It turned out that I probably shouldn’t have ambushed on CR all of a sudden just as I did immediately after finishing MGMAT guides. CR has continuously proven – even up to this point – to be my Achilles’ heel – I just couldn’t perform on CR questions as effectively as on SC questions, for example. Even RC, although I haven’t done much of it by the early autumn, was going better than CR at that time – don’t ask me why, I know it is odd, but I can’t really come up with a good explanation of the phenomenon. 

The whole CR fiasco that I had experienced demotivated me enough to, once again, just as one time before, leave GMAT abandoned for a while and focus on other things. In the depth of my soul, however, I still wanted to demonstrate (and, most importantly, prove to myself) that I am capable of getting an objectively good score, with which I could pursue my goal of doing Masters in U.S. 

The last turning point in my GMAT journey, after which there was no backing off, came around exactly two months ago. Out of the blue, I have found myself spending more and more time on tackling my favorite Quant and SC questions, as well as getting through and gradually improving in CR and RC. What seems very strange to me is that, now that I look back and try to understand what exactly caused me to restart my GMAT prep about two months ago, I still cannot attribute that decision to anything in particular. I just knew – I am going to reach the finish line now, and, luckily, I have had enough spare time to be allocated to that process. 

In about a span of two-three weeks in the end of November, I have reread all the previously read MGMAT books (again, though, while skipping books on RC and IR/AWA). As of then, I realized that I haven’t taken any practice exam yet, and, though hesitantly, I ultimately convinced myself to write one in the beginning of December. I chose GmatClub’s free CAT to do the honor, and after two tantalizing hours of solving Verbal and Quantitative problems I was left upset with an estimated “cold” score of 640 (Q45, V33). 

Though I was severely frustrated by such result, I just couldn’t let all of my previously put efforts go one more time. Instead of locking GMAT in a longbox for the third time, I persuaded myself to continue studying for it. As I was solving more and more problems, I came to the conclusion that my Quant was just in need of some extra polishing; on the other hand, Verbal was my apparent weakness, so I decided to allocate more of my time on getting better at the latter. 

After failing (and I mean so) considerably on my first mock, I recalled that I have also had OG’16 in my possession! On the very next day of remembering about its existence, I did the diagnostic test, on which I performed significantly better (around 710-720ish) in comparison with the GmatClub’s test. During the next three days I grinded the entire Quantitative section of the book, comprised of about 400 PS and DS questions of various difficulty.

Following the full completion of OG’s Quant, I decided to take my second exam – now via the platform of Official GMAT. Though I barely squeezed in the time on both Verbal and Quant (I altogether skipped IR and AWA), I was frankly shocked to see that I scored 760 (Q51, V42), a result in the 99th percentile. This mini-achievement was all I needed to continue my preparation and boost my confidence. From then on, my goal was to solidify my already strong stance in Quant and at least make sure that V42 wasn’t just a random manifestation of luck. 

For the next few days, I was relentlessly doing CR: not only did I browse about 2-3 hours a day on GmatClub’s CR forum, but also I completed all 134 CR questions in OG’s question bank, with an approximate accuracy of about 85-87%. It was then that I decided to go for the second free GMATprep mock exam. I set my objective very clearly: if I am able to get 730+, then I should start thinking of registering for the official exam, for I needed just a bare minimum score of 700/710. In a very similar fashion to how I wrote the first official mock, I attained a score of 750 (Q51, V40), and immediately afterwards I said to myself: time to register for the exam, time to beat the exam, time to forget about the exam’s existence. 

On January 9th, 2019, the next day after getting 750, I registered for the exam on January 17th, 2019. During these 8 days before the big day, I tried to balance my prep around all five major sections, as well as to learn about IR and AWA (honestly, had no idea whatsoever on what their purpose in the test was and what to do to score there well). I stopped devoting my time to OG, since I didn’t find any need to focus on SC and RC there, but at the same time I decided to run through both official mocks’ IR sections and MGMAT’s book for some advice on how to approach the two remaining sections. 

The last two-three days before the exam were the toughest, because at times I was feeling very insecure about my Verbal – even despite hitting 42 and 40 there recently – and I didn’t know any longer on how to improve it. On the contrary, I was very confident about my Quant, while IR and AWA, to be honest, did not bother me too much – they seemed fairly straightforward. 

THE BIG DAY: I woke up a bit earlier than usual, had a shower and a very petite breakfast. My exam was scheduled at 11:00 A.M., but because I lost almost all control over my nervous system and needed to confront the challenge as early as possible, I decided to arrive at the test center 40 minutes in advance. Here, in Yerevan, there is just one, relatively small-sized GMAT test center, and there are just three places for exam-takers. Luckily, in the whole building at the time I arrived there were only I and the exam moderator, who informed me that I was the only to register for the exam during the week (sounds insane, huh?). 

More or less relieved, I entered the test room and, as during practice exams, chose to write Verbal first. I noticed that I did the first 10 or so questions in about 10 minutes, quite confident in my accuracy rate, too. My answering pace for the section slowed down eventually, and for the last 10-12 minutes I even felt that I was lagging behind the schedule. My last 4 questions were associated with a very term-specific, unpleasant scientific RC passage; somehow, I dealt with it, although at the very end of the section my mind was erased entirely. Overall, I was preliminarily satisfied with how Verbal went, and was now preparing myself for my favorite section, Quant. 

Quant, however, caught me off-guard from the very beginning. Believe it or not, I got stuck on first two questions for sweet EIGHT minutes. That has never happened to me before in mocks, and I wasn’t prepared to that kind of crisis (up to this point I still cannot convince myself that these two questions were of a sub-600 or maybe even 600-700 level difficulty). While my brain was already signaling me: “that’s it, who needs your previous 51-s in Quant and all the good work done on Verbal before”, I was doing my best to resist the temptation of giving up entirely and tried to keep calm and continue solving problems. I will be honest with you, A NUMBER of Quant concepts and even types of problems seemed super unfamiliar to me or very rarely encountered before, on forum or even in OG. I started allocating less and less time on average for each subsequent Quant problem to compensate for the huge chunk lost in the beginning. Eventually, though I couldn’t even figure out how exactly I reached the 31th question, I submitted my answer choice for the last question during the remaining 5 seconds of time. On the duration of my whole second break, I was continuously convincing myself that perhaps Quant wasn’t as bad as I expected it to be, but, again, at that moment nothing in the world could justify to me such an awful (as I considered back then) Quant performance. That was especially bitter to acknowledge considering how well I was doing on Quant in general, before the exam.

I continued the exam by solving IR puzzles, which, mostly math-heavy, rather than language-heavy (thank God), were a piece of a tasty cake after Verbal and Quant. I did all the 12 problems in about 23 minutes, and was super confident about getting at least 6/7 there. Right afterwards, the AWA task popped up; I found the flaws associated with the argument and the conclusion, in particular, fairly quickly, so the AWA section itself was a breeze, too. 

I clicked “Next”. Are you sure you want to submit blah blah blah?, “Yes”. A moment of truth..

When I saw the score of 740 with the distribution of Q51, V39 and IR8, I blinked twice or thrice to make sure my exhausted mind wasn’t playing a bad trick on me; specifically, I was really disoriented by getting a Q51 – I wasn’t expecting it at all! I made a veeeeery deep exhale, immediately proceeded to accept the score, and exited the test room. I don’t think I have ever been as happy to receive a good exam score as immediately after finding out my GMAT score. Couple of hours passed from that moment, and here I am, formulating for already two hours all of my thoughts, emotions and, I won’t deny, sincere happiness and relief into this huge pile of text, just because, well, my post might be of interest to someone in the forum 


MORAL of my story, as the title suggests, is the following: Never. Give. Up. Period. The GMAT journey of mine has been abundant with both ups and downs, moments of instantaneous excitement and gratification upon getting an ultra-tough question correctly and moments of repetitive anxiety and disappointment with myself and my ability (or, rather, inability) to beat the GMAT. I am very positive about the fact that many readers of this post can very well sympathize with my ideas and concerns, so here it is – my post – to encourage you to keep fighting, and to further believe that you are 100% capable of getting not just your desired score, but even better than that :)

As for my plans for Masters, now that I am done with GMAT, I will start to look through the application processes of the desired schools very shortly. In case you feel you can help me with some must-know information with the applications in general or for certain schools in U.S., hit me up: I will share with you the specifics that you might need to construct your advices! 


TL;DR for PREP MATERIALS (jokes on you, no TL;DR for the whole text, I’d love you to read it entirely): 

Quant: MGMAT Books 1-4 (I found the book on Number Properties to be especially rewarding for Q51-aimers), OG’ 16 PS and DS sections with their respective question banks, and GmatClub’s Bunuel. Seriously, sometimes I felt that Bunuel and all his (her? their?) efforts and, especially, responses to tricky questions were more beneficial to my understanding of how to approach certain Quant problems than all the math books combined. Big kudos to you, Bunuel!

Verbal: MGMAT CR and SC (highly recommended!) Books, OG’ 16 CR question bank, and, again, DOZENS of questions on GmatClub. In Verbal forum of GmatClub, there is no such phenomenon as Bunuel of Verbal (although he (she? they? Eh, whatever) is quite active there, too!), yet there are a number of REALLY, really well-spoken experts, whose explanations are almost always more comprehensive than OE’s. Keep it up, dear experts! :)

IR & AWA: MGMAT IR & AWA guide was extremely helpful for me in providing the basic understanding of what the two sections were all about. Doing the 24 problems of two free GMAT prep exams, in my opinion, should be enough to be absolutely prepared for the section of IR. For AWA, make sure to glance over chineseburned’s AWA 6.0 guide, google it! 

IN ADDITION: I would also highly recommend that mobile users download the “Veritas Prep Official App” (not sure if it’s available on Android, but it’s there on Apple for sure), and do small quizzes there from time-to-time. By regularly using the application for about last month and a half of my prep, I have managed to run out of available SC, CR and DS questions – that’s how much time I was allocating to the software! The questions’ quality is EXTREMELY good, and the answer explanations are very student-catered and thorough. A must-have for an aspiring 700+ test-taker! 


Huh, I am finally done! Thank you very much for your time and attention! I hope you have a fantastic day, and good luck to you with your GMAT endeavors! :)

We're less than one week away from the beta launch of MBAJourneys,13,agnf79,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/agnf79/were_less_than_one_week_away_from_the_beta_launch/,9,"When I was preparing for the GMAT and getting my applications together in 2015, I remember being super frustrated with the lack of information about the true business school experience. Everything available online was just marketing material from the business schools themselves. Where was the authentic, honest insight into what bschool was like?

I took the GMAT 3 times across 11 months, including taking the Manhattan GMAT in-person class. The first two times I took the real GMAT I scored 710. I really wanted to give up right then and there and just settle with my 710. After all, it was above 700 and back when I was applying, the golden rule was to score in the 700's.

But I remember reading an AMA from a MBA grad from a top bschool and it got me SO motivated for business school. At that point, I was committed to giving the GMAT one last go so that I could say I absolutely, 100% put my best foot forward. 

So I committed to 4 more weeks of rigorous GMAT prep. Just 2 weeks before clicking submit on my applications, I took the GMAT for the 3rd time and scored a 740. I think taking my GMAT from a 710 to a 740 was what allowed me to get admitted to Haas as an overrepresented applicant, and were it not for that AMA, I would have settled with my 710 and perhaps not have gotten in.

So that's the inspiration for MBAJourneys. We're a platform for MBA's from top business schools to share their genuine, authentic bschool experience with the rest of the community. MBA grads truly are interested in sharing their stories too - that's why they come to reddit and do AMA's.

GMAT Math vs. School Math – Part II - Counting,3,ag39gm,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ag39gm/gmat_math_vs_school_math_part_ii_counting/,0,"In my [last article](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aen1j7/gmat_math_versus_school_math_all_testtakers/), we examined the importance of considering mathematical strategies other than those we learned in school. So, rather than approach a question as though our former teachers will be checking (and grading!!) every detail of our work to ensure the use of *appropriate* mathematical techniques, we should approach questions with the sole purpose of ***determining the correct answer as quickly as possible***, regardless of whether or not those teachers would approve.

In this article, we’ll examine an often-maligned strategy that can be applied to all counting questions:

**Listing and Counting**

Perhaps it’s its simplicity that makes listing and counting so unpalatable for many students. Granted, on the surface, it seems like a strategy a 5-year-old might use, but the fact of the matter is that, if you’ve been staring at a counting question for over a minute, and you still have no idea where to begin, you should either make an educated guess or start listing possible outcomes. In many cases, the simple process of listing outcomes will help us gain valuable insight into a fast way to solve the question. With this in mind, consider the following 400-level counting question:

**If repeated letters are allowed, how many two-letter words can we create using the 26 letters in the English language?**

**A) 52**

**B) (26)(25)**

**C) 26\^2**

**D) 2\^26**

**E) 26!**

Let’s start listing possible outcomes in a systematic way.

Words beginning with A: AA, AB, AC, AD,...., AX, AY, AZ (26 in total)

Words beginning with B: BA, BB, BC, BD,...., BX, BY, BZ (26 in total)

Words beginning with C: CA, CB, CC, CD,...., CX, CY, CZ (26 in total)

At this point we should see a pattern.

Once we’ve assigned in the first letter, there are 26 possible words. Since there are 26 possible first letters, and 26 possible words for each first letter, the total number of words = 26 x 26 = 26^(2) = C   

Okay, now try the listing and counting approach with this 600-level question:

**If repeated letters are allowed, how many 5-letter words can we create using only E’s and Q’s?**

**A) 10**

**B) 25**

**C) 32**

**D) 50**

**E) 120**

Have you tried it yet? Did you have difficulty finding a systematic way to list all of the possible 5-letter outcomes? If so, we might find it easier to start with 1-letter words, then 2-letter words, and so on.

1-letter words: E, Q (2 in total)

2-letter words: EE, EQ, QE, QQ (4 in total)

3-letter words: EEE, EEQ, EQE, EQQ, QEE, QEQ, QQE, QQQ (8 in total)

Aha! Each time we add a letter, the number of possible words doubles.

This means that there will be 16 4-letter words, and 32 5-letter words.

So, the correct answer is C.  

This last one is a 750-level question (at least!). See how you do.

**How many positive integers less than 1000 are such that the sum of their digits is 6?**

**A) 18**

**B) 28**

**C) 30**

**D) 36**

**E) 48**

In order to list the possible outcome in a systematic way, let’s treat all of the possible outcomes as 3-digit numbers where the hundreds digit and the tens digit can equal 0. So, for example, we’ll write 15 as 015, and we’ll write 6 as 006.

With this in mind, here’s one way to list the possible outcomes:

Integers beginning with 0: 006, 015, 024, 033, 042, 051, 060 (7 in total)

Integers beginning with 1: 105, 114, 123, 132, 141, 150 (6 in total)

Integers beginning with 2: 204, 213, 222, 231, 240 (5 in total)

See the pattern yet?

Integers beginning with 3: 303, 312, 321, 330 (4 in total)

So, the total number of outcomes = 7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 28 = B

**Final Words**

As you might imagine, listing and counting won’t be the best (i.e., fastest) strategy for every counting question. What’s important, however, is that you understand its potential value and consider it a worthy candidate when considering your options. ",1547517066.0

Raising my Quant score from a 33,3,afobr6,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/afobr6/raising_my_quant_score_from_a_33/,3,"I recently took my first CAT exam and scored a 580 (Q33, V37). I plan on having about 2.5 months to prepare for the GMAT and I'm aiming to score 730+. I'm enrolled in a 9 week prep course, and plan on studying between 180-200 total hours. While I refreshed some basic arithmetic concepts before taking the practice exam, I have used GMAT type math scarcely since I graduated college 3 years ago, and was relatively cold going into the test.

I'm confident I'll be able to raise my Verbal score to a level where a 730+ is attainable, but I'm worried about my Quant score. Does it seem feasible to raise my Quant score enough to put me in that range with the prep time mentioned above?

Guidance on a study plan to go from 730 to 750+,9,aenqxh,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aenqxh/guidance_on_a_study_plan_to_go_from_730_to_750/,3,"Hi all,

I would appreciate any advice or feedback on how I should approach studying for the GMAT, as I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by everything out there. Some background:

* I took one of the GMATPrep practice CATs on [mba.com](https://mba.com) cold with no prep to get a baseline and scored a 730 (Verbal 40, Quant 49, IR 8). I also took the Official Guide 2019 Diagnostic test which didn't give an exact score but scaled to a 720 using a guide I found online (the results were Excellent in Problem Solving, Data Sufficiency, Critical Reasoning, and Sentence Correction, and Above Average in Reading Comprehension). I feel like I struggled to finish the Quant section in the allotted time- I guessed on 3 questions near the end because I only had 8 minutes left for 5 questions and panicked, so any advice targeting how to speed up would be welcome.
* I plan to sit the exam during the second to last week of March, which leaves me about 9 weeks of study time. I can dedicate 3 hours of studying a day on weekdays, and 1 longer 4-5 hour chunk on one day of the weekend.
* The schools I'm looking at are Booth, Kellogg, Harvard, Sloan, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Would aiming for a 750+ be sufficient for these schools in a few years time, or do I need to go higher? Note that I will not be applying for at least 3 years since I am currently a senior in undergrad and will need to work for at least 3 years before my post-grad company will sponsor my MBA.
* I purchased the Official Guide 2019 bundle (OG, Verbal, Quant), and I have access to online versions of all the Manhattan strategy guides (a mix of 5th and 6th editions). I may also purchase the additional 6 CATs from Manhattan if those are recommended. Is this enough material to study with?

Lastly, how should I go about structuring my time? I've read that marginal gains near the top of the score range are the hardest to achieve, so I'm not sure if I should read all the Manhattan guides, focus on the OG questions, just take a bunch of practice tests, or some combination of everything.

If you've read this far, thank you! Any advice would be welcome.",1547155843.0

GMAT Math versus School Math (all test-takers should know the difference!) – Part I,4,aen1j7,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aen1j7/gmat_math_versus_school_math_all_testtakers/,2,"**The good news**: the GMAT Quantitative section tests concepts that you already learned in school.

**The bad news**: if you insist on always solving GMAT math questions using the same techniques you learned in school, you’ll likely score lower than you should score.

The problem is that achieving a high math score in school requires certain strategies that, if applied to the GMAT, can actually harm your score. To see what I mean, try answering this question:

**Claire has a total of 99 pets consisting of gerbils and hamsters only. One-quarter of the gerbils are male, and one-third of the hamsters are male. If there are 28 males altogether, how many gerbils does Claire have?**

**(A) 39**

**(B) 50**

**(C) 54**

**(D) 57**

**(E) 60**

When solving GMAT math question, it’s important to recognize (and embrace!) two major differences between school math and GMAT math:

1. School math questions are seldom multiple choice, and GMAT math questions are always multiple choice.
2. In school, your math teachers typically want you to show all of your work. So, even if you determine the correct answer, you won’t receive full credit unless you show all of your work. The GMAT has no such nonsense; a correct response is a correct response.

So, a student encountering the *Gerbils and Hamsters* question (above) in school would be forced to assign variable expressions to unknown values, create one or more equations, and so on. Fortunately, on the GMAT, we can use the answer choices to our advantage and plug in each value to see which one satisfies the given conditions in the question.

Now, at this point, you may be thinking (sarcastically), “Gee, I’ve never heard of plugging in the answer choices. Thanks Brent!!!”

Fine, plugging in the answer choices isn’t some remarkable new strategy that I just invented, but this poor strategy is, all too often, treated like a second-class strategy. It’s considered Plan B at best and, for many, it seems like a cop out. In fact, after using this strategy to solve questions in class, I’ve had students scrunch their noses in disgust and ask, “What’s the mathematical solution?” These same students often have a hard time accepting the fact that most GMAT math question can be solved using more than one approach, and the best approach is not always the one learned in school. **The best approach is the one that allows us to determine the answer as quickly as possible.**

The fact of the matter is that the original question can be solved in under 10 seconds. We’re told that ¼ of the gerbils are male, and the question asks us to determine the number of gerbils. Answer choice A says there are 39 gerbils, but ¼ of 39 is 9¾, and it’s impossible to have 9¾ male gerbils. In order to get an integer value for the number of male gerbils, the total number of gerbils must be divisible by 4. Since only answer choice E is divisible by 4, it must be the correct answer.

Of course, I specifically created that question to illustrate the utility of plugging in the answer choices, so one might argue that it’s unrealistic to think that this strategy always yields 10-second solutions, and I agree. However, it’s equally unrealistic to think that this strategy never yields the fastest solution. What’s important here is that you keep this strategy handy at all times. 

So, whenever you encounter a GMAT math question, you should always consider plugging in the answer choices as an option before choosing an approach.",1547151810.0

"730 (48Q / 41V / 7IR / 5.5AWA) - First attempt review, reflections, and planning for another attempt",25,aebxht,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aebxht/730_48q_41v_7ir_55awa_first_attempt_review/,8,"I wrote the GMAT recently, and scored 730 (48Q / 41V / 7IR / 5.5AWA). I'm going to write it again and attempt 760+. This community has helped me a lot so I thought I'd post some of my experience here too. 

A few thoughts for folks starting out (wrote this for a friend, copy pasted here):
----
- your base GMAT score (without any study) is basically going to be determined by how good you are at solving math problems quickly, reading fast and reasoning through arguments, and understanding grammar structure well.
- After studying though, you’ll realize that the GMAT just basically tests the exact same of problems over and over again. So there’s 2 things you should always keep in mind: 1) practice a LOT. And keep an error log of your mistakes - try to never make the same mistake twice. You’ll progress a lot fast this way. Time your practice sets too. 2) focus on your weaknesses and spend less time on things you’re already good at (like Math for example)
- Before you start studying, go to mba.com and download the practice tests. Do 1 before you start to find your strengths / weaknesses.
- Scoring 600-700 is a piece of cake if you’re good at English + Maths. 700 and above you usually need to understand the test and practice enough to get that - so you need to have timing down.
- There’s almost no correlation between the number of questions answered correctly and your GMAT score. Scoring well on the GMAT is a game of knowing when to guess a question and how to use your time wisely. There’s a link I’ve got bookmarked where it shows that guessing the first 10 questions gives a score of 29/51, the middle 10 gives 49/51, and last 10 49/51. I got 11 questions wrong for both Quant and Verbal, but my Quant score was 7 points higher. So that should give you an idea of how you really need to understand the GMAT scoring algorithm to focus your efforts well. Link: https://gmatclub.com/forum/new-format-gmat-prep-software-analysis-and-what-if-scenarios-269682.html
- For Quant, really try to understand how to solve the Data Sufficiency questions - you’ll usually have to simplify the given statements in your own terms to get answers quickly.
- For Problem Solving questions in Quant, about 30-40% of the time the best strategy is to plug in the given options and see which one works or work backwards / use elimination etc. 
- I was really bad at Sentence Correction so I read the whole Manhattan SC book, and did a lot of practice. I didn’t study Critical Reasoning or Reading Comprehension at all because I was already good at it. 
- Set hard timelines for yourself. Otherwise you’ll keep procrastinating (which I did...)

**Prep Materials:**

- The OG (Original Guides) by the GMAC are the only books you should use to practice. There’s enough material in there. There’s 3 books, pretty cheap.
- Manhattan set of books. These are really good for learning how to master every type of question, but there’s a lot to get through. I only read a few of them to focus on my weak points.
- Kaplan Guide / Kaplan 800. I only used the Kaplan 800 - I didn’t like the Quant at all, the questions were way too easy. The Verbal section had some decent practice questions but their answer logic was sometimes questionable.
- Gmatclub.com is amazing - they have a ton of free questions (especially tough ones) and a lot of discussion on pretty much every topic/question 
-I heard the Magoosh program is pretty good for staying on track - didn’t use it though. 
- The Economist has a free app that gives you gmat questions - good if you want to do a few between sets at the gym or something

Also, IR and AWA are useless and pretty easy so I didn’t study for either of those. Just did a few practice tests.

**Reflections based on my enhanced score report:**

- My quant subsections were all consistent, while my Verbal sub-section scores were quite lopsided.
- Not doing well at CR really hurts your score. I got every single RC right and most of SC but that was still only good enough for a V41 because my scaled CR score was 38.
- I made the mistake of not preparing at all for CR because I did well on CR in practice tests...but didn't do well on the actual test

**Path forward to getting 760+:**

- I need this because I'm going to be a low GPA / high GMAT splitter
- I'm going to have to master every type of quant question and improve my timing strategy. I'll also have to get fundamentally better at Data Sufficiency while practicing 700+ level questions
- I'm going to focus on improving CR and SC, while doing a cursory review of RC. I think I can improve my Verbal by 4-5 points. 

Happy to answer any questions if anyone has any.

Feeling hopeless. Scored 550 and would like near 700 for a M7 program. Always been weak in quant. Should i just study the GRE? Re-take the GMAT and pay for an in-person class?,5,aeg83r,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aeg83r/feeling_hopeless_scored_550_and_would_like_near/,3,"Growing up I was always ""behind"" in math relative to my peers. Or I've always thought. I find basic arithmetic more challenging, for instance if I needed to do a random calculation in my head (for ex., if I thought what's 8*17, I'll end up visualizing the math steps to get to 136). I did well in school everywhere else and went to a top-25 undergrad program with a degree in finance. I ended high school with 2nd-level algebra (did okay) and ended my freshman year in UG with a C- in calculus. So I've always felt ""behind"" compared to my peers.

I studied from 1/18 through 7/18, sometimes on/off due to work/life but studied for the last 3-months of the period quite hard. Started with the MGMAT books then then practice problems with the OG then online (Magoosh/EmpowerGMAT). Took the test July 2018 and ended scoring  Q/V/IR of 36 (29%), 29 (56%), 4 (28%) for a total of 550.

I took 6 practice tests that were not repeats and my quant range & mean score was 32-39; 35.8 and my verbal range & mean was 31-35, 32.8. So I scored right on top of my quant score and actually did worse in verbal (I know the exact 4/5-question long form reading section that I knew I got murdered on).

One lesson I learned was that my method of studying was ineffective. Just reading the MGMAT books and doing the practice questions did no good. I noticed I kept getting the same types of quant problems wrong. I ended up realizing that I should have been keeping a detailed error log. In the last 2-3 weeks before the test I did, and here's a summary of the results  http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=03662242729617062326 (for those interested). Obviously it was a little too late to really make much improvement.

So now it's the beginning of 2019 and I'd like to take a better approach to re-take the test. I'm a cheap-o and thought I could save money and self study, rather than shell out $1,000-1,500 for an in-person class. I have a decent job so could afford it, so maybe I should bite the bullet. I could also lay out a plan where i give myself 6-9 months to study without burning myself out. I could do an hour/two a day, but doing 3-5 hours a few days a week didn't help last spring.

Or, now I'm thinking that I could try my hand at the GRE, which I know has an easier quant section. It sounds like pretty much any top-25 MBA program accepts the test anyways. 

Hoping anyone could provide assistance or kind words.

"From 580 to 700, a grueling 2.5 year journey",34,ae5mde,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ae5mde/from_580_to_700_a_grueling_25_year_journey/,17,"First of all, I'd like to thank the community here for the amazing advice it provides and I apologize for this long winded post :). Over the past 2.5 years I've had 3 separate sessions on studying for the GMAT and even after 5 attempts I felt like it would be impossible for me to break the 700 barrier. While I know 700 is an amazing score compared to all the 740s-770s you see out there now, its a score that I'm happy with as it took a lot of hard work to get here. I want to share my experience as I know there are a lot of people out there like me who felt so dejected by this test and thought about giving up multiple times. I'm here to tell you to never give up, if I can do it so can you :).

I'm a non-native English speaker and I've been working in the health care IT industry for the past 6 years in the US, Middle East, and recently Singapore. My undergraduate was in Systems Engineering at the University of Illinois.

First session - August 2016 to December 2016
I started my prep with purchasing the Manhattan Interact course online supplemented with all the Manhattan prep books. The course proved extremely useful for familiarizing my self with the test and to learn strategies how to tackle certain questions. However I had a major timing issue in Verbal and Quant that I couldn't get over, I gave my first test on November 8 2016 and scored a 610 (Q45 V28). I knew I had to work on my verbal so I purchased empowerGMAT this time to try and boost my verbal score to take the exam again on December 26 2016. I focused on SC and CR since those were where I lost most points on the test, and while I felt I was getting better, I still struggled with timing. When I took the test again on December 26th, I scored a 620 (Q44 V33), and this time I struggled on RC.

At this point, I decided to take a break from the GMAT and wasn't planning to apply to schools until round 1 in fall 2017.

Second Session - April 2017 to September 2017
This time I knew I had to put all my efforts into raising my verbal score. I took some one-on-one lessons from Manhattan Prep and practiced from the OG, Verbal Review, and GMAT Prep question bank. I even purchased all 6 practice tests from GMATPrep. I started from scratch on SC, CR and practiced RC as well doing about 16 questions daily and focusing on their review and maintaining an Error log. This really seemed to work as I scored a 660, 690, 700 on my GMAT Practice tests, the highest I had scored. I was ready to take the exam again and scheduled it for July 22nd 2017.

I felt great during the test and seemed to be cruising along but when my final score came up, I was shocked. I got a 620 (Q42 V35), I thought to myself how did my Quant fall so low?! I had focused all that time on verbal leading me to suffer on my quant side as I made silly mistakes. I immediately canceled the scores as I did not want the schools to see my huge drop in quant. 

I decided to take the test again and this time add in a lot of quant studying as well. I used the same prep materials as last time but focusing more on quant now and took the test on September 23 2017. This time I could feel I was doing very well in Quant but Verbal seemed much tougher and I started to panic in the test, I was getting distracted by my panic and ended up wasting a few minutes over it causing me to guess a good number of questions. When the score popped up on the screen it showed a 640 (Q49 V29). I decided to accept this score but felt utterly defeated and thought I would never be able to break the 700 barrier.

At this point, work was starting to get very busy and I decided I needed to clear my head from this test. 

3rd and final session October 2018 - January 2019
I had planned to restart my studies in February of 2018 but I got an amazing opportunity for work in Singapore so I decided to move there. Life got extremely busy and there was never an opportunity for me to restart my studies. In late September I decided I needed to try for the GMAT again as I wanted to attempt to apply for business school again and change roles into product management.

This time I undertook the 3-month study plan, which btw is fantastic, that Magoosh has focused on improving my verbal score. I also purchased e-GMAT's online verbal course. This was a game changer for me, especially in SC, as I could now see the bad habits I had created by only looking for grammatical errors and not focusing on the meaning. For quant, I purchased the Quant review guide to practice problems from there. I made myself a daily schedule and made sure to stick to it, started waking up earlier in the day and even stayed later at work to study GMAT since I knew I would be lazy when I came home. 
My daily schedule consisted of the following:
[*]16 Verbal Problems (rotating between RC, CR and SC), and 16 Quant Problems. Reviewing them and creating an Error Log
[*] Read 2-3 articles from the Wall Street Journal
[*] Revise Error log

I did this consistently for 3 months and starting in mid- November I started taking weekly practice tests. My scores were the following:
[*]620 (Q44 V33) GMATPrep November 12
[*]700 (Q48 V37) GMAT Prep November 18
[*] 710 (Q49 V38) GMAT Prep November 25
[*] 710 (Q49 V37) GMAT Prep December 2
[*] 710 (Q49 V39) GMAT Prep December 9

I scheduled my exam for December 17 and was feeling very confident this time. I started the exam of strong with the verbal section first but was quickly thrown off by a hard SC question and wasted a lot of time on it. This sent me in a mode of panic and I decided to guess between 2 answer choices whenever I initially couldn't tell which was better. This led to my downfall as I stopped applying the principles I had spent months honing. Quant section seemed fine and I felt like the test went okay overall but when my score popped up and I saw a 580 (Q47 V23), I was in disbelief. How could I have scored so low after practicing so hard? And that too with the worst verbal score I had ever gotten in any capacity. After feeling sorry for myself for a few hours after the test, I believed in all my hard work and preparation and decided that it was just a bad day where I had panicked. 

I soon scheduled the exam as soon as possible as I wanted to submit my round 2 applications. I scheduled for the exam on January 8 2019. I followed my same routine as last time and took 2 practice tests from GMAT Prep before my real test. I scored a 710 (Q48 V40) and 750 (Q49 V42), the 750 was slightly inflated as I had seen some repeat questions. I made sure to focus on my methods during the practice test and not panic on hard questions. 

On January 8th I walked into the test center feeling extremely nervous. I did some deep breathing exercises and kept telling myself not to forget the principles I had learned. The test started out fine but got hard quickly but this time I didn't panic even when I saw I was 3-4 minutes behind. I stuck to my principles and towards the end, I ended up guessing 2 CR questions. The quant section seemed to go quite well but I was thrown off on how easy the questions were making me feel like I was making silly mistakes. So I slowed down a bit and finished on time. When I saw the 700 (Q48 V38) on the screen I could not believe it, after 2.5 years I had finally done it!

Key takeaways:
[*]While its good to focus on your weak areas, don't forget about your strengths as well and make sure to practice them!
[*]Focus less on doing questions and more on reviewing WHY you got the question wrong. Why was the answer you picked wrong? Why did you eliminate the right answer? What can you do next time to make sure you pick the right answer?
[*] The GMAT loves to see people panic. Make sure to remain as cool as possible even if you think you're not doing well.
[*]Believe in yourself :)",1547030009.0

Guessing on GMAT Data Sufficiency Questions,17,ad90j5,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ad90j5/guessing_on_gmat_data_sufficiency_questions/,0,"In this article, we’ll examine a guessing strategy to consider when tackling **advanced** Data Sufficiency questions on the GMAT.

To set this up, let’s assume that I’m working on a Data Sufficiency question, and I examine statement (1) first. 

Aside: There’s no rule that requires people to begin with statement (1). So, whenever I work on a Data Sufficiency question, I begin with the statement that looks the easiest to handle.

Okay, so let’s say that I begin with statement (1), and I find that it is sufficient. Whenever this happens, I breathe a sigh of relief. Why?

There are two reasons.

First, if statement (1) is sufficient, then I know that, even if statement (2) stumps me, I can be certain that I’ve already narrowed down the correct answer to either A or D.  

Second, if statement (1) is sufficient, then I know that I’m already halfway through the question. Conversely, if statement (1) is insufficient, I may not be halfway through the question, because if statement (2) is also insufficient, then I’m then forced to complete a time-consuming third step and see what happens when I combine statements (1) and (2).

As you might imagine, I’m not fond of Data Sufficiency questions that have C or E as the answer. Do I dislike these questions because they’re more difficult? No. I dislike them because they often take more time to answer.

**My Theory**

Because C and E Data Sufficiency questions typically take more time to answer, many students come to believe that these questions are more difficult than other Data Sufficiency questions. This belief can have unintended consequences.

Let’s say that you encounter a very difficult Data Sufficiency question on the GMAT, and you don’t have a clue where to begin. You’re unable to make any progress with either statement, so you’re forced to guess. What’s your guess? Well, if you believe that C and E Data Sufficiency questions are especially difficult, you may be inclined to guess C or E.

Bad idea. There’s a big difference between *difficult* and *time-consuming*.

The truth of the matter is that the correct answer to an advanced Data Sufficiency question is more likely to be A, B or D (remember “BAD”) than C or E.   

This, of course, doesn’t mean that the correct answer to every advanced Data Sufficiency question is A, B or D. However, these answer choices are more likely. We can see this in the Official Guide (13th edition), where all 174 Data Sufficiency questions are arranged by level of difficulty. 

Among the last (hardest) 30 questions, the breakdown of correct answers is: 

* A: 23%  B: 23%  C: 7%  D: 37%  E: 10%

Compare this to the breakdown of correct answers for the first (easiest)­ 144 questions:

* A: 19%  B: 19%  C: 18%  D: 26%  E: 17%

Now, it’s important to note that we’re talking about **advanced** Data Sufficiency questions here. In other words, the “BAD” strategy is meant for questions in the 80th percentile and beyond. So, if your quantitative score is average or below average, and you encounter a difficult Data Sufficiency question, this strategy may not apply. Having said that, if the practice questions in the Official Guide are representative of the official test, it still appears that A, B and D might be appropriate responses to any difficult DS question.

UK Master's in Finance Programs?,6,ad4hfx,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ad4hfx/uk_masters_in_finance_programs/,4,"Hi All,

Have any of you previously applied to MFin Programs at the top UK schools (LSE, Oxbridge, Imperial, LBS, Etc..)? 

I have about two years private equity analyst experience in a middle eastern country in a well-reputed local firm. I graduated from a top 30 school in the US with a major in finance. My cumulative GPA was 3.2 (but my GPA during my last 3 semesters was 3.6+). I know my cumulative GPA is low but it took me time to adapt travelling 10,000 miles from home for the first time to live alone at the age of 17 in a foreign country that I've never visited.

I recently took the GMAT and was disappointed to have gotten a 670 (V35 - Q47) since I put so much effort into trying to get a 700+. I wanted to ask if you guys think I have a strong enough profile to be considered by these schools for their MFin programs.

Most of the posts on here are about how to get high scores. I do want a high score when i take the GMAT, but I just want to have enough to get accepted and not much more.

The reason being, I'd rather spend my time learning other things than what the angles of a triangle add up to. I really don't care about that and I don't think employers will either. So my goal is to get at least a 600 to meet a requirement. And after getting > 600 on the gmat, learn other new things to add to my resume and application. 

So, i haven't taken any practice tests yet, i did a little studying so far. My question is, I have the official GMAT material for 2019, and  I want to only study the easy level material and then take the test.

I've been studying consistently over the last month using EmpowerGMAT and TTP, and the score today was lower than any practice exam over this period. 

I've taken 3 practice exams in the last month with the following scores in chronological order:

580 (V31, Q38)

600 to 730 - the 10 week slog.,24,accdxq,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/accdxq/600_to_730_the_10_week_slog/,16,"I sat the GMAT just before Christmas and ended up with a 730 (Q44, V46, IR7). I've found the community here to be really valuable during my prep so wanted to round off with a few notes. 

&nbsp;

**Test Results:**


+ 600 (Q32, V40)
+ 710 (Q45, V42)
+ 760 (Q49, V46)
+ 740 (Q42, V51)
+ 750 (Q47, V47)
+ 730 (Q41, V51)

&nbsp;

**Official GMAT:** 730 (Q44, V46, IR7) 

&nbsp;

I started off by buying the OG bundle on Amazon - OG 2019 + the extra quant and verbal questions. I took the OG diagnostic and quickly realised my math skills were really rusty, so bought the MGMAT Math Foundations book. I worked through that quickly and say my first official practice test on the 3rd of November.

&nbsp;

The practice test made me realise the importance of specific GMAT test taking strategies like timing, dumping hard questions etc. It was obvious verbal was a strength and quant was a weakness, and I considered doing TTP and just working on quant. I read a few posts here and researched the scoring algorithm, and decided that I should be maximising my verbal too. 

&nbsp;

With that in mind I signed up to EmpowerGMAT and really enjoyed the course. I did a free intro class with Manhattan and loved it, but thought it was too expensive for me. I tried some of the other online courses but found that they were weak on verbal, using their own question stems with grammatical / spelling and other errors. I liked that Empower used questions from the official guide and then provided video explanation to those questions. 

&nbsp;

I'd started down this road late in the application cycle and knew I'd only have one shot to sit the GMAT, so I tried to eliminate all of the potential pitfalls that could occur on test day. I bought the replica scratch pad and pen and used that to study. I read the reviews here religiously and used the videos / tutorials on MBA.com to familiarise myself with test-day procedures. I even took the train and visited the test centre a couple days before to work out the route. 

&nbsp;

In the end the test went pretty well - I started with Verbal and found it a little harder than my last few practice tests, while Quant was difficult but probably went better than I expected. I was in a daze going through IR and AWA, knowing that they wouldn't contribute to my overall score. 

&nbsp;

I think I have the potential to score better in the GMAT but for the moment I think 730 is enough for my target schools. 

&nbsp;

**Random thoughts / advice:**


* In terms of study materials, OG is best. I bought GMAT 2019 but it's not necessary to get the latest version - in fact there were probably more answers etc. for the 2018 version. I didn't use the two additional books (quant / verbal) at all, though if you have more time they would be useful. 
* I tracked everything pretty meticulously - my hours studied, questions answered, errors made etc. This was partly for motivation, so that I could see my progress, but also to identify areas to improve. I used the GMAT Club Guide to OG 2019 to track all the q's I answered in the OG - I ended up answering 58% of the questions in the book. 
* I studied for 201 hours overall. If I had my time again I would have spread that out over a longer time period but it feels about the right amount if you are aiming for 700+. 
* Pick the online course that resonates best with you. They all have free trials, make the most of them. Personally, I found EmpowerGMAT to be really fantastic, although the software used to deliver the course felt a little clunky. The content, video explanations and pacing were fantastic though. 


&nbsp;

I spent a lot of time reading the reviews / debriefs here and found them really useful. They were great motivation to keep putting the hours in to get a good result. If you have any questions I'll do my best to answer them. ",1546562374.0

Avoiding Silly Misteaks on the GMAT,18,ac8nuu,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/ac8nuu/avoiding_silly_misteaks_on_the_gmat/,10,"In this article, we’ll examine some strategies for avoiding careless mistakes on the GMAT. My primary focus will be on minimizing errors in the Quantitative section of the test, but some of the strategies can be applied to the Verbal section as well.  

Now, before we examine these strategies, I should point out that some can be quite time consuming. So, before you consider implementing any of them, you should first confirm that you are, indeed, prone to making silly mistakes.

**The “Silly Mistakes” Story**

For some students, the *Silly Mistakes* story is something they tell themselves to cope with less-than-ideal test scores. After all, it’s much easier on the ego to convince yourself that you made silly mistakes than to recognize that you may have some gaps in your knowledge. So, let’s be clear about what constitutes a silly mistake.

**Silly Mistakes - Defined** 

We’ll begin with mistakes that cannot be classified as “silly.”

Using complex algebra to solve a word problem in 3 minutes when you could have plugged in the answer choices and completed the question in 1 minute is not a silly mistake. The problem is that you failed to consider a different/better/faster approach.

Not knowing where to begin on a complicated geometry question is not a silly mistake; it’s an indication that you need to go back and review the rules and strategies for solving geometry questions.  

Failing to check the answer choices and use general approximation to quickly answer a question is not a silly mistake, and forgetting that most probability questions can be solved using either probability rules or counting techniques is not a silly mistake.

All of the above examples are indications that you do not yet possess the tools necessary to answer those questions.

Silly mistakes are a different matter. These are instances in which you possess all of the necessary skills to solve a question, yet something went wrong nonetheless.

A silly mistake is when:

* you multiply 3x^(2) by 2x^(3) and get 5x^(6), even though you know the Exponent Laws backwards and forwards.
* your sloppy writing causes a 7 to mysteriously turn into a 1.
* you forget that a question is an EXCEPT question.
* you fail to notice crucial information such as “x is an integer” or “w < 0.”
* you calculate Pat’s current age when the question asked for the Pat’s age 5 years from now.

Aside: What kind of maniac asks, “How old will you be in 5 years?” Well, it turns out that the GMAT test-makers ask this kind of question. . . . just to see if you’re paying attention.

If you are, indeed, prone to making silly mistakes, consider the following advice.

**Mindset**

First off, try to make a conscious decision to stop referring to yourself as someone who makes silly mistakes. I’ve met a lot of people who practically brag about making careless errors, and this negative mindset can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, be the person who strives to minimize silly mistakes rather the person who dwells on them.  

The remaining strategies are based on the types of mistakes that you’re prone to making. The two primary types are:

1)    Reading errors

2)    Computation errors

The strategies that you employ will depend on the type of error.

**Minimizing** **Reading Errors**

Reading errors are mistakes resulting from sloppy reading and/or poor retention. If you typically make a lot of reading errors, then consider the following tips.

To begin, keep a record of the types of reading errors you make. Some common types are:

* Failing to notice restrictions on numbers. Examples: “*x* is positive” or “*k* is an even integer.”
* Answering the wrong question. Example: you calculated the time in hours, but the question asked for the time in minutes.
* Forgetting that a question is an “EXCEPT” question. 

Once you become keenly aware of the types of reading errors you typically make, you’ll be able to spot the *potential* for silly mistakes before they occur. This step alone may be enough to prevent most reading errors.

Now, if you employ the above strategy and the reading errors persist, then there are other approaches to consider. Just keep in mind that these strategies have the potential to be very time consuming.

An obvious strategy for students who make frequent reading errors is to slow down and carefully read…every…single…word.

The next tip is to fully engage in what you’re reading. All too often, under the pressure of a formal test, students lose focus, and their minds wander. So, be sure to use some of the strategies you use when engaging in Reading Comprehension passages. For example, feign interest (Fantastic! A question about ratios!!), or visualize the given information.

Aside: more engagement tips can be found in the following video: [gmatprepnow.com/module/gmat-reading-comprehension?id=1123](http://www.gmatprepnow.com/module/gmat-reading-comprehension?id=1123))

Another strategy to consider is to record key information. For example, if you’re prone to answering the wrong question, then you may want to write down the required task. So, if the question asks you to calculate the diameter of a circle, use your noteboard to write “diameter = ?” so that you don’t carelessly calculate the radius.

Finally, if you’re still making reading errors on a regular basis, you may need to read the question (or passage) twice. Another option is to read the problem, answer the question, and then reread the question before entering your answer. Time consuming, yes. But, this approach may be necessary to improve your score.

Okay, so those are some tips that may help you minimize reading errors. Now let’s examine some tips to help you minimize computation errors.

**Minimizing Computation Errors**

Computation errors are errors that yield an incorrect answer even though you possess all of the skills needed to answer the question correctly.

As with reading errors, you can minimize computation errors by first recording the types of computation errors you typically make. Some common types include:

* Brain fart. Example: concluding that 7 times 9 equals 56 . . . oops.
* Too many mental calculations. Example: solving the equation 5x – 7 = 1 – 3x in your head and incorrectly concluding that x=4 . . . oops.
* Messy writing. Example: writing 7/2 as part of a calculation and later reading it as 1/2 . . . oops.

Once you’ve identified the types of computation errors that you typically make, you can spot their potential a mile away. The remedies for computation errors are pretty straightforward. To prevent brain farts, take your time and consider performing some calculations twice. To prevent errors resulting from too many mental calculations, use your noteboard more often. And to minimize messy writing errors . . . improve your penmanship.

With a little work and some common sense, you should be able to reduce the frequency of silly mistakes and get a GMAT score that actually reflects your abilities.",1546540870.0

I am pretty burnt out now, so I am going to take a break for a couple months and focus on reading more. I'll probably push one last  time for 700+ in the summer.

Here are my test results. I started studying about 2-3 hours a day in the beginning of October.

Material I used:

1. Magoosh 
2. TargetTestPrep (TTP)
3. OG 19 Guides
4. MGMAT SC Correction
5. EGMAT Verbal

**My recommendations:**

**For Quant:** TTP is a no brainer. I started the program at the beginning of October and finished it in the first week of November (about 2-3 hours a day). The course is extremely thorough and will give you all the tools needed to solve any quant problem if you complete it in its entirety.

Magoosh is good budget option, but if you have the money and are targeting Q47+ go for TTP.


**For SC:** Start by watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8YVymgVTcg) series to understand how to approach SC questions, then learn the specifics from MGMAT SC Correction Guide

**For RC/CR:** The strategies outlined by Magoosh worked well for me for both RC and CR. Magoosh also does a very good job of providing concise explanations for all answers.


I've read a lot of good things about EGMAT, but I personally did not find it very useful as a native English speaker. I didn't always agree with their answer choice causing me to lose confidence in their approach.

750 (51Q / 41V / 8IR / 6AWA) - First attempt debrief/post-mortem and considering a 2nd try,4,abdak0,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/abdak0/750_51q_41v_8ir_6awa_first_attempt/,6,"I've really appreciated all of the anecdotes shared - I found it a helpful way to mentally prepare for the test, so it's my turn to pay it forward. I prepped for about 4 full weeks while working full-time, which in retrospect was less time than I would have liked (I think 2 months would have been ideal for me, but it is going to be different for everyone depending on starting point/goals). For some background, I generally test well and have a lot of experience studying for and writing exams. I wrote the ACT twice, scoring 31 in 2006 and 32 in 2007 which were 98/99th percentile respectively, and I wrote and passed all 3 CFA exams. 

**Diagnostic CATs**

* GMAT Prep 1: 710 (48Q / 40V / 8IR) - After taking this test I quickly realized that I was making a lot of errors due to being unfamiliar with the test structure and types of questions, particularly data sufficiency, thus I wanted to take a second diagnostic test immediately in order to see how much of the issue was due to this lack of familiarity.

* GMAT Prep 2: 760 (50Q / 42V / 8IR) - I was pretty happy with this result. My takeaways were 1) I probably didn't need to study for IR, 2) I wanted to tighten up quant because I could tell that with enough practice and repetition I should be scoring 50-51Q consistently and this seemed to be the most predictable way to improve my performance, and 3) I had some room for improvement on verbal, particularly sentence correction.

**Study Materials**

GMATClub Quant Guide (read entire pdf)

Manhattan Foundations of Verbal (read entire book and worked through exercises)

Manhattan Sentence Correction (read entire book and worked through exercises)

OG Guide 2019 Bundle (all Q's in OG Guide, all of the quant book, and half of the supplemental verbal)

GMAT Prep 3-6

*Kaplan 800 (ordered this but I regretfully did not have time to work through it)*

*Manhattan Advanced Quant (ordered but did not work through this book as I was short on time and already comfortable in quant)*

**Quant**

I scheduled my studying by section, starting with quant because I thought that my learning would be stickier (e.g. I would be less likely to forget quant stuff I learned 4 weeks out vs. verbal idioms 4 weeks out). I read through the GMATClub quant book, which was really comprehensive, then just crushed through OG Guide practice questions. Aside from refreshing a few concepts, the key progress for me was from churning through practice questions, specifically by making mistakes and auditing the mistakes. I did all questions available because even easy questions were valuable - nothing teaches you to tighten up careless errors like getting easy questions wrong, and even practicing concepts you already know can be a valuable way to increase your speed and reinforce the concept. Sometimes I would even check the answers for questions I got right but felt there was an easier/better approach. Going through OG Guide quant answers really helped me get a better idea of how the test writers are approaching each concept, I also prioritized OG Guide questions for a similar reason. I kept a log of all the questions I got wrong throughout the OG Guide and supplemental quant book, and then after I was done all questions I went back and re-did all the questions I got wrong and iterated a second time on any I got wrong for a second time (if there's anything you're getting wrong a second time I would recommend really thoroughly going through the answer and spending the time to really understand it - search out multiple explanations if possible, GMATClub is great for this). It took me a bit over a week and a half to work through all this, which left me with just under 2.5 weeks for verbal + GMAT Prep 3-6.

**Verbal**

First I worked through both the Manhattan books mentioned above, then I started doing OG practice questions. My verbal study was very focused on improving sentence correction as I felt it was the easiest to study for (most ""fixable""), and I was also consistently doing better on RC/CR questions in the OG Guide (>90% correct on each of RC/CR individually). In hindsight, I wish I had more time to grind through more practice questions for each. I only had about 1.5 weeks to study for verbal because I wanted to reserve the last few days for practice tests (GMAT Prep 3-6).

**AWA / IR**

I probably cannot provide much help here as I did not prepare much for either section. My only prep for IR was the questions in each GMAT Prep test, because I was consistently scoring 8 with a lot of extra time. For AWA I just prepped the night before by planning out a basic general template for the essay. I would note that the AWA section is very time pressured if you try to write 5 full paragraphs which I did - I literally hit the period on my last sentence as the timer ran out and didn't have time to proof-read. In retrospect it's really important to organize your thoughts and balance your speed because shifting parts around will get you in a lot of trouble given the time pressure (I had to move a few things around and it was not pleasant).

**The Last Week**

* GMAT Prep 3: 760 (51Q / 41V / 8IR) - I wrote this 5 days out from the actual exam. I made 2 errors in Q and 6 in V. 

* GMAT Prep 4: 760 (51Q / 41V / 8IR) - I also wrote this 5 days out from the actual exam. I made 0 errors in Q and 8 in V.

* GMAT Prep 5: 770 (50Q / 44V / 8IR) - I wrote this 3 days out from the actual exam. I made 5 errors in Q and 4 in V, the Q errors were mostly stupid, preventable mistakes and not an issue with content, so I was very encouraged by this result. 

* GMAT Prep 6: 770 (50Q / 44V / 8IR) - I wrote this 2 days out from the actual exam. I made 2 errors in Q and 3 in V.

Aside from the 4 practice tests above, I spent some time during the last week on sentence correction problems as well as auditing my errors across all the various questions I had done (including practice tests). The last night before the exam I tried to relax and read a little bit about the AWA section. Given the practice test results, I felt like I would probably get 1-2 questions wrong on Q which would be a 50-51Q, and I expected 3-5 questions wrong on V which would likely be a 41-44V. My practice test scores were consistently 760-770, so I was expecting about the same on the real thing. I felt like with the right mix of questions I could get lucky and get 770-780.

**Test Day**

* 750 (51Q, 41V, 8IR, 6AWA)

My essay was the last section, and as I mentioned it was a rush to the finish - the score screen hit me by surprise because I wasn't even thinking about the fact the essay was my last section. I was honestly a bit crushed when I saw the score screen. Ironically, on test day I had the most time pressure on Q and IR, arguably my two strongest sections. I got a tricky geometry question in the middle of the test that ate up a lot of time, and a few data sufficiency questions that I felt the need to spend extra time on early in the test in order to ensure I got them right. On IR I was having this massive brain fart and spent about 10 minutes on a simple question because I kept losing track of what it was actually asking for (this never happened to me during prep, so I chalk it up to test day jitters). I honestly lost some sleep over getting a 41V, which I know sounds stupid - I ordered the ESR the next day and I'm glad I did because it's surprisingly helpful in understanding what happened on test day.

**ESR / Post-mortem**

My quant ESR is pretty straightforward. I made one mistake during  the last quarter of the test on a high difficulty geometry DS question - I'm pretty sure I know the exact question and it didn't click for me how I should've answered it until a week later (and now it's painfully obvious). Quant is very straightforward to study for, but sometimes you just don't see what you need to see when you're budgeting 2 mins/question.

Verbal on the other hand was one pleasant surprise and an otherwise frustrating realization. If I'm reverse engineering correctly, I got 8 questions wrong which was as bad as my worst practice test. The good news was that I only made 1 mistake in sentence correction and scored in the 98th percentile to SC - I was really happy with this as I really emphasized it while I studied and was most worried about it. The flip side is that I guess I neglected CR/RC. It looks like I made 2 mistakes on CR (91st percentile) which I'm pretty frustrated by, and I definitely think I can improve. But worst of all, that means I made 5 mistakes on RC (64th percentile). On first glance, this seems completely counter to everything I knew about my performance going into the test. RC was actually where I performed the strongest when doing practice questions, followed by CR, then SC.

Having had more time to think about it, my frustrating results on the verbal section actually make a lot of sense. Even if you do practice exams under time pressure, it's impossible to fully emulate test conditions due to some intangible factors. It's possible I just got the wrong mix of questions, but my suspicion is that a combination of nerves and mental fatigue got the better of me. I strategically put verbal as my first section because I wanted to be fresh for it, but I think the start of the test is when I was most nervous. Further, even though it was the first section, I still think mental fatigue was an issue. I definitely noticed that I didn't feel as sharp on test day - this manifested noticeably on IR and Quant via the aforementioned brain farts, but it's harder to notice on verbal because you just fall for trap answers that *seem* right. On Quant I could tell when I was making a mistake and would re-do the question or double/triple check if I felt shaky, but it's not the same on verbal. And with Quant, I drilled through so many practice questions that I could rely more on something like the brain equivalent of muscle memory. Though I did quite a few RC questions, I was probably much fresher when I was reading the OG Guide passages and I couldn't emulate the time pressure and stress-induced mental fatigue of the actual exam - I didn't have the same type of mechanical ""muscle memory"" with RC.

In summary, it might be crazy but I'm considering re-writing. First, I'm an ORM planning to apply for a few M7's for 2020 matriculation and merit-based scholarships could be make or break in terms of my ability to attend. Second, because I feel like there's tangible room for improvement, I'm tempted by the personal challenge of re-writing - I'm disappointed in my result and feel I could have been sharper. I would've liked to have finished all OG questions for verbal and gone through the Kaplan 800 book.

Please let me know if anyone has any tips or experience trying to raise a respectable verbal score to an elite one! As well, happy to answer any questions anyone has.",1546303748.0

My starting score was 620 (Q45/V30) last winter and I have not taken any math course in over a decade. Below is a snapshot of my preparation and experience:

**Things that worked:**

Quant: Target Test Prep, Manhattan Prep

Verbal: Magoosh, Manhattan Prep, Power Score Critical Reasoning Bible

Practice test: GMAC only

Studying a minimum of 1 hour every single day for 3 months

**Things that did not work:**

Private tutor via Wyzant ($75-$100/hr) \~ $3,000

Inconsistent study schedule

Writing the exam multiple times right after I completed the Manhattan Prep Course.

**Takeaway:**

You can conquer the exam with enough targeted practice. I completed over 3000 quant and 1500 verbal questions by using the various resources above and only then did I feel truly confident that I would score 700+ on the exam. My GMAC practice exam scores ranged from 700-770 during the last month of my prep.

**Things I would do differently if I could start from scratch:**

I would probably sign up for Manhattan Prep Boot Camp Plus rather than wasting three grand on a private tutor. Then I would sign up for target test prep and purchase the Power Score book and enroll in a formal logic course for CR.",1546052552.0

Big dip in practice test scores (740 -> 690) despite better overall performance,6,aad33c,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/aad33c/big_dip_in_practice_test_scores_740_690_despite/,5,"Hey everyone, here are my results for the official GMAT Exams (1&2):

As you can see, my overall score fell significantly between the two tests, despite my quant performance being better and my verbal performance being only slightly worse.

With that being said, could someone more familiar with the scoring algorithm offer some insight?

I'm working hard on my quant skills but I don't see myself bringing the verbal section to a level consistently above 32/26, so the V42 is really bothering me.

Also, please note that this is in no way meant to be a humblebrag; my goal is a 700+ so the 690 isn't exactly disheartening. However, I'm still surprised by the fact that your overall score can take such a big hit from a seemingly minimal change in performance. ",1546023151.0

I've found this sub extremely helpful over the months leading up to my first attempt a week ago. So, thanks!

Target MBA year: Fall 2020

Score: 680 (Q40/V42). 

Target score: >= 720

Prep: I didn't follow any strict pattern while preparing for the exam. Just attempted all of the questions in the OG 2019, OG Review Quant, and most of OG Review Verbal. Reviewed all of my mistakes, and also did 6 practice tests from GMAC. My performance in verbal was quite consistent. Usually around 40 - 3 points here or there. Quant, on the other hand, seemed very erratic. Sometimes I scored 40-41; sometimes 48-49.

So, I was hoping to get some advice on a couple things regarding the retake:

1) When? - Due to certain work commitments, I wouldn't be able to take out any time between 15-Jan and 15-June. So, would it be better to cram over the next 2 weeks and give it again before 15th January, or wait, start prep in July and give it another shot in August/September?

2) Quant strategy - I consider myself relatively strong in quant; I have a background in economics, statistics, and mathematics. However, for some reason, I couldn't perform consistently while practicing for GMAT. How would you recommend I go about trying to bring that Q up from 40 to over 47? Any advice is welcome - preferred materials, test-day techniques, study schedules, etc. - I'm all ears.

Any suggestions and tips for CR materials?,3,a9p58i,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a9p58i/any_suggestions_and_tips_for_cr_materials/,3,"Hi guys! 

Just finished my GMAT and scored a 610 (Q42 and V31). This was my 2nd attempt. In my first attempt I scored 620 (Q49 and V27). Got hit in quants in my recent attempt due to over confidence and had to guess a few questions at the end due to time mismanagement. (Lessons learnt- never under estimate your strong area.. Always have a strategy for all the sections) 

Following are the splits for my verbal, which was always a hard part for me:

SC - 40 (last time it was 34)
RC - 36 (last time it was 19)
CR - 17 (last time it was 29)

This results were expected, as I was not confident in CR even before the start of exam (Anyways I gave my exam as I wanted to apply before Jan deadlines.. I may have to delay that). I was able to form the right strategy and  practiced well for SC and RC. But CR remains vague too me. 

Can anyone recommend any good study materials, online course or strategy for CR? 

Thanks!

Large difference between MGMAT and Official Practice CATs,3,a9owxx,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a9owxx/large_difference_between_mgmat_and_official/,5,After a couple months of studying I took the official GMAT Practice exam and scored a 660 (43Q 38V) and was feeling pretty good. That was about 2 weeks ago. Two days ago I took the MGMAT practice test and scored a 590 (39Q 33V) yikes! Which test is a more accurate indicator of performance? Has anybody else seen a big difference between the two? FYI I took two MGMAT CATs before this and scored 560 and 610,1545834067.0

Basic grammar question about placing two modifiers,5,a9kc02,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a9kc02/basic_grammar_question_about_placing_two_modifiers/,3,"I'm going through MGMT's SC book, and I've stumbled across something that isn't consistent in my mind.  Hoping you can help get things straight.

Based on my current understanding, if an essential modifier and a non-essential modifier both modify the same noun, I should put the essential modifier first, the non-essential modifier second.

E.g. The box OF NAILS, *which is nearly full*, belongs to Jean.

Where the CAPS is the essential modifier, and the *italics* are the non-essential modifier.  Makes sense; I'm clear.

However, later in the book in a practice problem, something similar comes up, but it is treated differently.

Regina returned the dress, *which was torn at one of the seams*, TO THE STORE.

Here, the order for the correct answer has switched on me.

So I think there are a couple of things maybe going on here.

1) ""To the store"" is actually a non-essential modifier?  I was previously under the impression that non-essential modifiers were separated by commas, but I could certainly see that not always being the case.

2) So if ""to the store"" is also a non-essential modifier, and there are two non-essential modifiers present in a sentence modifying the same noun, how do I know which one should go first?

Any clarity you guys can provide would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

Help me overcome this psychological/time management dilemma on Quant!,7,a72oeb,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a72oeb/help_me_overcome_this_psychologicaltime/,7,"Hi all,

As always, thanks for your help! A few more days to go until my exam, and I need your help with getting in the right frame of mind on Quant re: skipping questions.

My issue is that when I get to Quant questions that totally stump me, I tend to linger on them. I feel a compulsion to keep working on it and try to find an answer, trying quite a few different points of entry and subsequently going over my two minutes, without even getting close to an answer. This sets me back on time, and forces me to ""guess"" (i.e. randomly pick an answer without even reading the question) on problems in the future just to make up the time.

I recently took an official CAT and found that I lingered on questions that I ended up guessing and getting wrong anyway, and guessing on easy questions for the sheer fact that I had to catch up to my pacing and the clock.

What is the best strategy for skipping quant questions? At what point should I throw up my hands on a question and decide I'm better off moving on and saving time for questions I can actually tackle, but just need a little more time to complete? How do I feel more confident about doing this and tear myself away form the compulsion to ""try"" questions anyway.

To start off, I’m ambitious. Ideally, I would like to apply to a number of schools in the top 20. My goal is 720+. I’ve taken the GMAT three times, with the last being almost exactly two years ago. I self cancelled two tests (640, 660) and kept a score of 680 (47Q, 37V). The test I just signed up for is on May 4th, giving me about four and a half months to study. 

I guess I’m looking for some advice. Admittedly, my studying has been flippant. I took all three tests immediately post graduation from undergrad when I was just starting work and learning how to be an adult. I know I didn’t put in the time or effort needed to really succeed, and from what I understand the test is “studyable” in the sense that it can be beaten with a combination of strategy and knowledge. 

I know that I have the stuff to score well. On one of my canceled exams I scored in the 95th percentile in verbal, but bombed the quant. On another, I scored well on quant, but not great on verbal. From my perspective and self-reflection, I think that quant is my weak point when it comes to the test, along with some anxiety, and a lack of dedication to studying. 

Personally, studying has always been difficult for me. I prefer a rigidly structured regimen and had a tough time finding a program that would cover all the bases while providing a sense of structure. Maybe I wasn’t looking in the right places. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? I know this post doesn’t really seem to have a direction. I plan to look through the sidebar and assess different programs available. I’ve already purchased the newest OG, have a Magoosh subscription, have MGMAT advanced quant and a number of their other volumes. How can I put it all together? Are there programs designed for about four months of study time? 

I appreciate everyone taking the time to read my rambling. I think I’m just looking for some motivation/direction. ",1545011921.0

Over the last 2 weeks, I did 2 practice exams through Veritas prep and I am super confused about the scoring. 

&#x200B;

On practice exam 1, I score 620 with the following distribution:  
Quant: accuracy of 61%, percentile of 43 and section score of 42. I got 12 incorrect (6 in both DS and PS) and 19 correct (7 in DS and 12 in PS).   
Verbal: accuracy of 72%, percentile of 71 and section score of 34. I got 26 correct (6CR, 10RC and 10SC) and 10 incorrect (3 CR, 2 RC and 5SC)

&#x200B;

On practice exam 2, I score 650 with the following distribution:   
Quant: accuracy of 52%, percentile of 55 and section score of 45. I got 15 incorrect (8 DS and 7 PS) and 16 correct (6  DS and 11 PS).  
Verbal: accuracy of 53%, percentile of 71 and section score of 34. I got 17 incorrect (4CR, 7RC and 6SC) and 19 correct (6CR, 5RC and 8SC). 

&#x200B;

Can someone explain how I managed to score higher on the second test even though I clearly performed worst? I am confused because I thought the score was based on the number of questions you get right.

Also, surprisingly, I did a total of 4 practice tests overall (1 initial Kaplan before beginning my study), 1 OG and 2 Veritas and I always scored 34 on the verbal section.

I started to study for the GMAT since September and two days before the exam I scored 670 (49Q / 33V), which was consistent with my past scores (590, 610, 640, and 680 over the course of 40 days) and enough to apply to the schools I want (Kelley, Krannert, Gies, and Weatherhead, in order of preference). 

However, after I did the exam on Thursday, I couldn't believe my scores: 49Q / 16V, 540 overall.

Yes, someone who prepared this 3 months and lived in US 2 months to get used to the language got 16 in Verbal (percentile 12). **Holy shit**. I have actually never seen/listened a drop like that before. My boss told me that my luck was the opposite of winning the lottery.

To be honest, I wasn't nervous during the course of the exam. My first guess is that I just don't know English grammar very well, and I don't know how to answer RC and CR properly. That's why I'm asking for help in Verbal. I have a large question bank, so what I need the most is texts, books, videos, etc, to fully understand English grammar and also techniques to ace RC and CR.

Also, and given the little time I have to do another GMAT exam, is applying in Round 3 a bad idea for a South American guy?

Advice on improving that Quant score?,3,a6j6t2,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a6j6t2/took_a_blind_shot_at_the_gmat_today_wanted_to_get/,3,"So, based on my percentiles for each section, my Quant is *way* out of balance with IR and Verbal. Has anyone been able to really drag up their Quant score after the first take? What did you do specifically? I haven’t done algebra since high school so just doing practice problems over and over again probably won’t help as I don’t really even remember how to do things as simple as long division. Should I look at getting a tutor? How long would you recommend waiting until I take another stab at the test?

Secondarily, my final score of 610 is actually higher than the average for at least one of the programs I will be applying to. Should I send the score to them? Or is my Quant score so low that my total score wouldn’t even matter?

Any other tips or anecdotes on how you improved your scores would also be appreciated.

The second attempt was a couple months later and I studied well I had thought. But came out with just a 600 (V33/Q40) I kept the score but obviously broken about it. 

This time, I went through everything Manhattan, did both OGs and felt ready. I slept well, felt well prepared and ready to go. I felt like I was crushing it until I saw that I got a 620 (V29/Q46). 

Im pretty shattered right now cause now I have only 2 more attempts left for the rest of the 12 month period and was hoping to finish applying to schools for the September round. Now I feel like I'm fucked.

Got a 770 (49Q/48V) on my GMAT today! Very excited about the result. Here’s how I did it if anyone is interested (very centered around 80/20 principal),52,a51r2z,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a51r2z/got_a_770_49q48v_on_my_gmat_today_very_excited/,41,"Background: I’m in my last semester at college (planning on applying to MBA in 4 years, matriculating in 5 years) and had a lot going on, so if anyone is trying to get the most out of a limited amount of prep hours (and funds) this is a pretty effective and straightforward strategy in my opinion. 

1. 4 months out, I took one of the 2 free practice tests before getting started to get a feel for how much work I had to do and what my most glaring weaknesses were (several categories in quant). I then tried to start an Ecom business (that unfortunately failed hard) so I put all prep on hold for 3 months

2. Then 1 month ago I bought the OG + the 2 supplementary books on Amazon and did all 300 questions in the online version of the quantitative book in study mode over the course of 2 weeks (reviewing wrong answers after each session)

3. Then I did about 300 more questions from the online version of the main OG, then I went through all the questions I missed and tried to figure out what my weaknesses were (mine were geometry, systems of equations, and permutations/combinations), so I spent about 1-2hrs on each one on 700-level questions on GMATclub.com for each category until I understood most of the principles. 

4. Then a week before test day I re-took the first practice test, got a 770 50Q47V but wasn’t sure what could be attributed to the questions being vaguely familiar from 3 months before

5. Then 2 days before test day I took the 2nd Free practice test to make sure I have a feel for timing, the interface, etc. and got another 770 50Q47V (though not under strict testing conditions)

6. Then yesterday I spent a few more hours on my weaknesses in the 700-level quant categories on gmatclub.com, read an article about how to get a good score on the AWA (I’ll let you guys know how effective that article was when I find out my score in a few weeks), then took the night completely off and went to bed at 8:30pm

7. On test day I woke up 2 hours before my 8am test to meditate, do cardio, eat a lot, and drink a ton of coffee. Got to the test center 15min early. Doing it again, I would’ve gotten up even earlier because I wasn’t completely focused during my first section (quant). In the end I got my target score though, with my verbal scoring a point higher than both recent practice tests to pick up the slack for the point I lost in quant. 770 49Q48V



All in all I would say these were the biggest keys to success:
1. The OG and quant guide in STUDY mode. After every wrong answer, I would read and think about the explanation until I 100% understood 
2. Obviously this depends on your career plan/timeline, but I believe taking the GMAT in my last semester of college helped my score materially due to mental energy, freshness of some verbal muscles, and being in “study mode”, YMMV
3. I spent a huge amount of time over the last 3 years learning French and Spanish; I think spending 1000+ hours actively thinking about/analyzing languages over that time was the main reason I did so well in verbal. Obviously there are more efficient ways to do well in the verbal section though if you don’t care to learn foreign languages hahaha.
4. Not giving up on questions - forcing myself to reread and think about the explanations on both OG and gmatclub until I was positive I understood the concept. I forced myself to do this while maintaining real-exam pacing, which helped prepare me to manage my time today.

Not trying to promote anything, just wanted to share my experience. Hope this helps those who may be very time-constrained, let me know if you have any questions!

&#x200B;

Some of you may already know me here.  I have been lurking on these boards for a couple months, taking in what I can and leaving advice for others when I feel it is applicable.  I write this post for all the other lurkers out there who suffer from low self-esteem, feeling as though they will never be able to do well on the GMAT. This is for you guys.

&#x200B;

About me :  I am an atypical MBA candidate.  My undergrad degree was in music.  I always did well in my music classes and did extremely poorly in other subjects, mostly due to not really caring.  I never had an aptitude for mathematics and never felt as though I was intelligent or talented at much of anything.  I decided to change my life around a year ago with aspirations of going to business school.  I began studying for the GMAT around 4-5 months ago, give or take.

&#x200B;

In the beginning of my journey I did what most others do ; I bought the MGMAT books and began studying.  At this point I didn't even know how to do long division or multiplication by hand.  I didn't know what ""prime factorization"" was and I was beyond horrible at algebra. Slowly, I began to re-learn math literally from the ground up.  Progress was slow and painful.  Eventually, I signed up for TTP (Target Test Prep) based upon positive recommendations found on this sub-reddit.  I hated it and dropped it after a month or so.  I tried out trials from a couple different companies and landed on Orion, by Veritas.  Orion was fun but I felt as though it didn't really go deep enough on certain subjects.  Despite this, I continued on and finished about 90 percent of the program.

  At this point, I took my first and only practice test, scoring a modest 650.  Keep in mind, this was after around 2.5 months of studying.  If I had to guess, in the beginning I was probably below the 500 level.  My verbal was OK and my quant was average.  I decided to try my hand at the actual GMAT and scheduled my first ""real"" test.  I bombed it, leaving the test center with a 620 and a severely damaged ego.

&#x200B;

At this point my self-doubt began creeping in again.  My mind was filled with negative thoughts.  I began thinking that maybe I really wasn't cut out for this, and that my natural level of intelligence just wasn't high enough to get a decent score on the gmat, despite working hard.  After my first test I took a vacation for 3 weeks and didn't study at all, still dealing with feelings of inadequacy.  When I returned home, I decided that I would take the GMAT once more, because if I didn't I would probably regret it forever.  I schedule my re-take for around a month out from this time.

&#x200B;

For my re-take, I decided to go straight to the source, the OG.  I began grinding OG questions daily and started an error log.  When I missed a question, I immediately looked it up on GMATclub to try to make sense of it.  After going through the entire OG I began repeating the questions that I had missed my first time through.  Around this time I also began working through the math section of NOVA's gmat prep course, a book that I highly recommend for quant.  Seriously, go out and buy it/ download a pdf, it is great and really helped me with my math skills.

&#x200B;

On the day of my re-take I was still dealing with my insecurities. I did what every good GMAT student is supposed to do - A good night of sleep, decent breakfast, coffee, snacks for the test breaks, etc.  I entered the test center almost as nervous as I had the first time. I began my test with Quant, seeing as it was the section I was most nervous about.  As I began I was feeling pretty good ; the test wasn't throwing any crazy questions my way and I felt as though I was getting most of them.  I began to get nervous around halfway through quant because I felt that the questions were not getting harder, meaning I wasn't doing so well.   I didn't get any combinatorics, etc.  Anyway, I chugged along and felt pretty good when the section was over, feeling confident that I had done at least a little bit better than last time.

&#x200B;

I began verbal and was initially pretty focused but got thrown off by a few hard RC and SC questions.  I felt as though I was bombing the section, seeing as I lacked a lot of confidence in my answers and wasn't getting any ""bold face"" CR questions.  Verbal was really kicking my ass and I knew it.  I began to run out of time and had to push through the last 5-6 questions in around 5 minutes, meaning I mostly guessed.  At this point I was confident that I totally ruined my verbal score and would be getting something around a 620, or worse, as I did last time.  I pushed through IR and AWA, but at this point my mind was pretty burnt out.  Seriously, pushing yourself mentally for 3 hours isn't easy, and I could tell that I was slipping. As I finished my essay my heart was beating out of my chest.  I was nervous and had already felt defeated.  

I pressed the ""next button"" and was greeted by a score of 700 - Q47 V40.  I was beyond shocked.  I gathered my belongings, took my score printout from the test center, and walked outside.  On the way to my car I almost began to cry.

&#x200B;

I know that for a lot of people here a mere 700 may not be impressive, but for me it was a goal and I ended up achieving it.  I don't come from a ""quant"" background, I always did pretty poorly in school, and I always doubted myself.  Despite this, I worked my ass off and was eventually able to get my dream gmat score.  This is a message to everyone else out there suffering from the same lack of self-esteem that I did - You CAN do this.  You may have to work harder than others, but you can perform well on the GMAT if you don't give in to your negative thoughts.   Best of luck to all my friends on this sub-reddit.

Listing Possible Values in a GMAT Remainder Question (article),3,a53mxj,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a53mxj/listing_possible_values_in_a_gmat_remainder/,0,"To set up this article, please try solving the following question:

**x and y are positive integers. When x is divided by 11, the remainder is 5, and when x is divided by 34, the remainder is 27. When y is divided by 17, the remainder is 11, and when y is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. What is the least possible value of x + y?**

**A) 7**

**B) 19**

**C) 38**

**D) 53**

**E) 89**

This question can be quickly solved using an important property that can be applied to a variety of remainder questions on the GMAT. Before we examine that property, however, let me ask you an easier question:

**When positive integer N is divided by 148, the remainder is 94. What is one possible value of N?**

When I ask this question in class, 242 is often the first number suggested by students. If 242 was the first number you thought of, then you probably had great difficulty solving the question at the top of this article. The problem is this: while 242 does, indeed, meet the given condition (242 divided by 148 equals 1 with remainder 94), there’s a much easier number that should come to mind first. That number is 94. Notice that 94 divided by 148 equals 0 with remainder 94. Also notice that it takes no mental math to come up with this possible value of N. 

A lot of GMAT remainder questions feature information about the remainder when some integer, say N, is divided by another integer. In these cases, it’s often useful to list possible values of N by applying the following rule:

**If N and D are positive integers, and N divided by D equals Q with remainder R, then the possible values of N are: R, R+D, R+2D, R+3D,. . .** 

Example: When positive integer J is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So, the possible values of J are: 2, 2+7, 2+2(7), 2+3(7), 2+4(7), etc.

Once we evaluate these, we find that the possible values of J are: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, etc.

Now back to the original question:

**x and y are positive integers. When x is divided by 11, the remainder is 5, and when x is divided by 34, the remainder is 27. When y is divided by 17, the remainder is 11, and when y is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. What is the least possible value of x + y?**

**A) 7**

**B) 19**

**C) 38**

**D) 53**

**E) 89**

***When x is divided by 11, the remainder is 5:*** So, the possible values of x are: 5, 16, 27, 38, etc.

***When x is divided by 34, the remainder is 27:*** So, the possible values of x are: 27... STOP. Since both lists include 27, the smallest possible value of x is 27.

***When y is divided by 17, the remainder is 11:*** So, the possible values of y are: 11, 28, 45, etc.

***When y is divided by 3, the remainder is 2:*** So, the possible values of y are: 2, 5, 8, 11...STOP. Since both lists include 11, the smallest possible value of y is 11

Since the smallest possible values of x and y are 27 and 11 respectively, the smallest possible value of x + y is 38. So, C is the correct answer to the original question.

**The Big Takeaway**

When solving remainder questions on the GMAT, you can sometimes save yourself a lot of work by listing possible values and, more importantly, by beginning with the smallest possible value. ",1544503414.0

Best Study Plan for a 5 and a half weeks,5,a4izae,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a4izae/best_study_plan_for_a_5_and_a_half_weeks/,4,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm planning to take the GMAT for the first time in mid-January, with the goal of scoring a 650. I wanted to see if anyone had recommendations for a 5 week intensive self-study plan that I could use. I've already gotten the 2019 OG, but I'm struggling to find out which books will be best to use along side during that time period.

&#x200B;

Now, just so you know, I scored a 470 going cold on a practice test from the MBA Prep site. I understand that given this score and the research I've done online, I'll be hard pressed to get a 650. I do not plan to let this deter to me though, as I'm able to study 8-10 hours a day, everyday until the test date. I also have no commitments during that time, so I'm able to fully engulf myself into the materials every waking moment, and I actually enjoy the routine of studying like this. 

&#x200B;

I plan to lean heavily in quant during this 5 weeks, as this is biggest weakness right now. From what I could tell in the practice test, I have most of the foundations but I just kept making careless mistakes over and over. A majority of the questions I had missed, I felt I should've known when I saw the explained solutions.

I'd love to hear any recommendations or advice on exactly what I should do.  ",1544338711.0

Adopting the Mindset and Body Language of a GMAT Destroyer (article),9,a3uvkb,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a3uvkb/adopting_the_mindset_and_body_language_of_a_gmat/,1,"Most GMAT students don’t spend enough time considering the mindset they’ll need on test day. In a different [article](https://www.gmatprepnow.com/articles/junior-girls-volleyball-scoring-big-gmat), I suggested that the simple act of smiling can increase your performance. In this article, we’ll go a little deeper and examine how confidence (even fake confidence) and body language can help you conquer the beast.

**Confidence**

A math professor once told me that excelling in mathematics is 80% confidence. I think this percent is somewhat high, but I agree that confidence is a must-have ingredient in mathematics, as well as in a variety of other endeavors, including the GMAT.

Students who lack confidence are chronically afraid of the GMAT and, on test day, they spend far too much time engaged in counter-productive thinking: *I wonder how I’m doing*.\* I hope the reader likes my essa*y.* Did I answer that last question correctly\*?\* I’ll die if I bomb this tes\*t. This is a huge waste of brain power. What’s worse is that a submissive mindset leads to second-guessing, which causes test-takers to waste valuable time double-, triple-, and quadruple-checking their responses.

So, how does one overcome a lack of confidence? One approach is to confront each negative thought with a positive affirmation:  *Things are going really swell! The reader will love my essay! I’m sure I answered that last question correctly! I won’t bomb this test!* I don’t recommend this approach.

The better approach is a preemptive strike that prevents the negative self-talk from occurring in the first place. To do this, you must adopt an attitude of unwavering superiority. On test day, you must assume the role of a painfully smug know-it-all, the kind of person everyone disdains. Of course, if you don’t want to be an object of disdain, then keep these thoughts to yourself, but that shouldn’t diminish the outrageously cavalier commentary taking place inside your head.

So, how does all of this play out? First, act as though every question is painfully easy and fails to even scratch the surface of your advanced skills. In fact, the entire test is beneath you.

But what if you can’t answer a question? No problem. Make an educated guess, and say to yourself, “I’m not going to waste my time on such a ridiculous question.” Then move on and never look back. Always engage with the question at hand, and always maintain your air of superiority. If you can pull this off, you won’t be handcuffed by meek thinking.

**Body Language**

In addition to assuming the role of a consummate know-it-all, be mindful of your body language. Believe it or not, your posture and where you place your arms and legs will affect your performance. For example, making yourself big (sitting upright, legs spread out, arms wide) will actually cause changes in hormone levels. In fact, this particular seating position causes cortisol levels to decrease, which, in turn, helps you handle stress more effectively. Crazy but true. For more information, watch this amazing [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html), in which Amy Cuddy explains how our body language affects a lot more than how others see us. I should also mention that the talk spends some time looking at how body language can help students succeed in Business School, so be sure to watch it.

**Final Words**

To achieve your target score on test day, you need to know a lot of quantitative and verbal concepts, and you need to know how to apply GMAT-specific strategies. You also need strong test-taking skills, like time management and endurance. All of these are important, but they mean nothing if you fall apart at the test center. Proper mindset and body language are important components of your GMAT prep, and they can go a long way to help you get the score you deserve. ",1544146433.0
From 0 knowledge about the test to GMAT assassin in 2 weeks,8,a3sfgh,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a3sfgh/from_0_knowledge_about_the_test_to_gmat_assassin/,11,"This is an extended version of my EMPOWERgmat review (confirmation pending). I just thought it would be helpful to share my experience in more detail.

As the title suggests, I took the GMAT just two weeks after learning what this test is all about. And on my first try, I beat the GMAT with a score of 720. So yes, this is possible, but I would advise against trying this at home. Those were two weeks of very intense studying for 10+ hours a day. Not many people can afford to spare this much time on prepping and have the resilience to study for this long. I know that many of the folks here have a significantly higher score, but my goal was to get a result of 700+ and I did just that.

On my first day of prepping I took a ""cold call"" practice test and scored 660 on it. Everything after that can be considered an improvement of this score. My initial verbal score was significantly higher than my quant score, so I focused first and foremost on improving my quant results.

I spent the next four days revising high school algebra and geometry, which I had completely forgotten at the time. For this, I used simple high school textbooks that I still had lying around. I don't think it really matters what you use at this stage, so khanacademy or any GMAT prep course will do just fine. Then came the time to choose a GMAT course. I took free trials of several different courses and evaluated them during my fifth day.

In the end, I chose EMPOWERgmat for several reasons. Not only was it one of the most affordable courses on the web, but it also focused on really beating the GMAT, not just studying for it. Moreover, something about how Rich explains things, his charisma, really clicked with me.

Unlike other courses, EMPOWERgmat doesn't just prepare you for the questions but tries to use every trick in the book to help you get the right answers effectively and efficiently. For the quant section this mainly revolves around three Empower tactics: Test It, Test The Answers, and Triage. These tactics are very simple, yet extremely helpful for saving time on the test.

I had already been fairly strong at verbal from the start, the only part of it that I still had some trouble with was sentence correction. To be perfectly honest, I think I lucked out with this section on my first practice test, as most of the choices where I wasn't certain about the right answer and had a 50/50 chance between the right answer and the runner-up turned out to be correct. I suspect that my score at the time should have been lower because of this. The way Max taught me to read answers to sentence correction questions vertically instead of horizontally really helped stabilize my score.

After 8 more days of preparation with EMPOWERgmat, I felt confident enough to take the real test. The Pearson testing center welcomed me with dimmed lights and closed doors. The instructions stated that I should come 30 minutes early, but the staff of the center only showed up at the time of the exam.

Another thing that came as a surprise for me was the rule that I cannot write anything on the pad during the break. So after entering the exam room but before starting the actual test, I asked if I could write things on the pad now. Upon confirmation that this is allowed, I wrote an entire page of ""ABCDE""s for the verbal section, which I would later use to cross out the wrong answers. This saved me 5 minutes during the exam.

The biggest problem that I faced when taking practice tests was my inability to solve all the questions on time. This was partially due to some practice quant sections being harder than the real thing (looking at you, Manhattan and Caplan tests), partially due to insomnia from which I suffered for the good part of the two weeks of my prep, and partially due to me still not having mastered the Empower tactics. I studied those tactics well and had a good night's sleep before the real test. As a result, I was able to go from having to triage the last 10 questions of the quant section to having to triage just the last 2 or 3. This made a significant difference in my score. And with the answer template for the verbal ready, I was able to finish that section on time without having to triage anything.

I  can't say much about the AWA and IR sections, because apart from practice tests I didn't prepare for them at all. Still got a perfect 8 on IR and a sufficient 4 on AWA though. All in all, it was a fun experience and a challenging two weeks of my life. EMPOWERgmat helped me a lot with it.

I was targeting above a score of above 600 to get into my target school - most told me this was achievable but I haven't done any math since I left school about 10 years ago.  Sat my first GMAT Prep exam before even starting to study (which I realise now was probably a mistake) and was deflated when I scored a 510 - there was a lot of work to do.

I walked away today after sitting my first official exam with a 650 (43Q / 37V).  I was ecstatic as I felt like I completely bombed quant and my timing was pretty bad.  My highest GMAT Prep Practice score to date had been 660 so I'm pretty happy to get close to that in the real thing.

Question about experimental questions on official GMAT,2,a3kw66,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a3kw66/question_about_experimental_questions_on_official/,5,"From what I've read, the GMAT contains a number of experimental questions on the exam. These questions don't impact your score? 

Let's say to manage time you guess a couple of questions so that you can spend a bit more time on others. If you don't know which questions are experimental vs real, you could end up spending more time on experimental questions, guessing on real. Or the other way around (guess experimental, spend more time on real). 

Depending on how this goes, couldn't this impact your score significantly? E.g. in scenario 1, you get the experimental correct but they don't count, while you guess the real and lose points. Scenario 2 is reversed - you use all your guesses on q's that don't count, maximising the real ones you get correct. 

This doesn't seem right... is there something I'm missing? Or does this explain why GMAT official scores can fluctuate so wildly compared to official pracs? I'm guessing there's no way to determine if q's are real or not...",1544073550.0

Meanwhile the Quant is enraging. I don’t know if it’s how the questions or written, but I get done with the quant I feel like I’ve just been put through the wash. It’s horrible. 

I’m improving with my OG quizzes and practice problems but these cats are very discouraging. It’s almost hard to even see them as a useful measurement device. 

Has anyone else had similar issue with the Kaplan CATS?",1543967067.0

Using An Error Log,4,a2vf62,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/a2vf62/using_an_error_log/,7,"Hi All,

So I created an Error log, I just went through ~230 OG book problems, with error log writing Correct, Wrong, Tricky all in an Excel. 

My question was how did you sum up which type of questions you got wrong the most? I.e. Geometry, Number Prop, etc etc

Can't seem to think of an excel function to solve it.

Col 1 has type of problem, col 2 has if I got it right or wrong. 

Thanks in advance! ",1543885656.0

I'm currently going through the MGMAT strategy guides and doing the problem sets in them. I will have \~2 weeks left when I finish them to study the official books (with 5+ hours each day for the official books the last 2 weeks).

My question is how I best approach the official books? I know I can go online and sort through different subjects, but at the moment they seem a bit overwhelming as compared to the easy MGMAT strategy books approach of just going through them 1 by 1.",1543867912.0
